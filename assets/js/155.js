Many fish use a swim bladder filled with gas to maintain neutral buoyancy, and when the fish dies that balance is no longer maintained. Often that will result in an excess of gas, and a fish fill float to the surface. Of course, being a light gas, which has presumably come about from biological processes within the fish, the weight of the fish doesn't change - it's just the density that changes.
