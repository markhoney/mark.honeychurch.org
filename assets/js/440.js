Part of the profits from sales go to the person who made the sale and part to the company making the product, but a third part is shared between the people above the seller in the pyramid. Therefore it's beneficial for members of the scheme to sign up people below them, as they can then take a share of the profits from sales they haven't had to make themselves.
