Ken has no solid scientific basis for his claims, and seismologists don’t take him seriously. He doesn’t have a proven track record of being accurate with his predictions, no matter what he says to the contrary. We would have expected that, by now, Ken would have compiled an extensive, robust list of successful predictions that show how well his method for predicting earthquakes works - not just a list of successes, but a list of failures as well. We would also have expected to have seen an improvement in accuracy over time, as he hones his technique.")]),e._v(" "),a("p",[e._v("Of course, Ken tends to be quiet about his failed predictions, and only talks about the times they could be described as accurate.

Ken has been accused of scaremongering in the past, and we would love to see him refrain from making public predictions until such time as he’s managed to first convince seismologists that his ideas are correct. Telling the public about his earthquake predictions before he’s verified his hypothesis is a dangerous thing to do, and is jumping the gun in a way that is considered unethical, and even illegal, in other parts of society - for example, people in New Zealand are not allowed to sell or advertise cancer treatments before they’ve managed to prove to the government that the treatment actually works.")]),e._v(" "),a("p",[a("em",[e._v("I asked him about the NZ Skeptics view of his work - he said you're 'skeptical for the sake of being skeptical' - again can I ask for your view on that?")])]),e._v(" "),a("p",[e._v("The NZ Skeptics are skeptical of all claims - we expect that any claim should be backed up by evidence. The more extraordinary the claim, the higher we set the bar for convincing us that it is true.

Scientists have better things to be doing with their time than arguing with a person who has no expertise, no credibility, and a silly sounding idea.

Whereas scientists tend to be skeptical within their area of expertise, skeptics have a very broad range of interests, and we tend to apply our skepticism to anything that we consider isn’t being challenged by others. So in a way, yes, we are skeptical for the sake of being skeptical. We enjoy looking into fantastical claims and finding out if there is merit to them, and pretty much any claim is fair game for us - we have no sacred cows.
