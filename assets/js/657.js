Although as a skeptic I find it hard to believe people when they tell me that they have figured out the secrets of the universe, nonetheless I enjoy hearing others’ ideas and seeing what kinds of people are attracted to these groups.

After all, many of these groups are selling a false bill of goods - they promise to impart the secrets of the universe to you, and then they take your hard earned money and don’t deliver the goods.
