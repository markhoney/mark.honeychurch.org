We show that the existence of life on the earth may be a reason that this black hole like object is a black brane that has been formed from biological materials like DNA. Size of this DNA black brane is 109 times longer than the size of the earth’s core and compacted interior it. By compacting this long object, a curved space-time emerges, and some properties of black holes emerge. This structure is the main cause of the emergence of the large temperature of the core, magnetic field around the earth and gravitational field for moving around the sun. Also, this structure produces some waves which act like topoisomerase in biology and read the information on DNAs. However, on the four-dimensional manifold, DNAs are contracted at least four times around various axis’s and waves of earth couldn’t read their information. While, by adding extra dimensions on 4 +n-dimensional manifold, the separation distance between particles increases and all of the information could be recovered by waves. For this reason, each DNA has two parts which one can be seen on the four-dimensional universe, and another one has existed in extra dimensions, and only it’s e_ects is observed. This dark part of DNA called as a dark DNA in an extra dimension. These dark DNAs not only exchange information with DNAs but also are connected with some of the molecules of water and helps them to store information and have memory. Thus, the earth is the biggest system of telecommunication which connects DNAs, dark DNAs and molecules of water."')])]),e._v(" "),t("p",[e._v("The paper’s author, Dr Massimo Fioranelli, mentions on "),t("a",{attrs:{href:"https://www.massimofioranelli.com/",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"}},[e._v("his website"),t("OutboundLink")],1),e._v(" (in Italian) that:")]),e._v(" "),t("blockquote",[t("p",[e._v('"Ho studiato varie discipline a connotazione "naturale": la medicina fisiologica di regolazione, la nutrizione, la medicina low-dose, la fitoterapia, l’agopuntura, il microbioma, le tecniche psicologiche, la mindfulness, la meditazione, lo yoga e molte altre."')])]),e._v(" "),t("p",[e._v("Thankfully google translate makes a good effort at making sense of this for me, given that my grasp of Italian is non-existent:")]),e._v(" "),t("blockquote",[t("p",[e._v('"I studied various disciplines with a "natural" connotation: physiological regulation medicine, nutrition, low-dose medicine, phytotherapy, acupuncture, microbiome, psychological techniques, mindfulness, meditation, yoga and many others."')])]),e._v(" "),t("p",[e._v("So it looks like Dr Fioranelli has taken the Kool-Aid of alternative medicine, and as so often happens this has likely led him down the path towards believing in all kinds of unproven nonsense, and even now making up his own novel (read: daft) ideas.")]),e._v(" "),t("p",[e._v("(As a side note, I was going to be clever and mention that at Jonestown the cult used Flavor-Aid rather than Kool-Aid in their massacre, but I’ve "),t("a",{attrs:{href:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kool-Aid#In_popular_culture",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"}},[e._v("now learned"),t("OutboundLink")],1),e._v(" that the cult had both brands of flavoured drink mix at Jonestown, and it’s unclear which was used on the fateful day)")]),e._v(" "),t("p",[e._v('Weirdly this article was published in a special "Global Dermatology" issue of the journal, which makes me wonder whether it just bypassed peer review all together - after all, it’s hard to see how a black hole in the centre of our planet which allows communication between our DNA and a higher dimension DNA has much of anything to do with skin, hair or nails.
