This time we were asked (by National MPs Simeon Brown and Melissa Lee) to pray for our country’s leaders, and for Christian MPs. My group included someone who spoke in tongues, but what was more surprising was that when we were asked to pray for MPs the prayers turned weird. My prayer partners started talking about how they wanted god to take control of MPs when speaking on issues, to cause them to speak words that they would not normally speak - and that in doing so, they would be left wondering why they spoke contrarily to their beliefs, and this would bring them to know god. The idea that there are people in this country, people who deem themselves to be upright and honest, who would like their god to remove the free will of those they disagree with leaves me feeling pretty creeped out.")]),e._v(" "),o("p",[e._v("Despite this unease, at these events I pray to ensure I fit in - I prayed last week about the failed cannabis referendum (which, incidentally, I voted for not against - unlike Jacinda, I’m happy to talk about how I voted!).")])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);t.default=n.exports}}]);
