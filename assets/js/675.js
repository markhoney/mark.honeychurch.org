Most of these people will end up losing money during the time they take part in an MLM, but despite this people tend to think that if they work hard enough they’ll be the exception, and that they’ll turn a profit.

The biggest problem for someone running a Ponzi scheme is that some people will eventually want to cash out their money, including the profits they’ve been promised. The scammer will often try to convince the investors to keep their money in the scheme, either by reminding them of the amazing profits their money is making them or by offering them an exclusive new tier of investing with even higher margins.

In a pyramid scheme there is either no product being sold, or the product is not a major income stream for its participants.

This is not sustainable, as most people who sign up for the scheme will find themselves at the base of an ever widening pyramid - a place where your money has been paid upwards to those towards the top of the pyramid, and nobody is signing up below you to allow you to recoup your costs and turn a profit. A fully signed up pyramid scheme will run out of people very quickly. In New Zealand, with a population of 5 million, for a scheme where everyone recruits 10 people below them, by the seventh level of recruits there are not enough people in the country to fill all the places.
