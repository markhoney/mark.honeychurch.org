It might well be that more damage would be done by trying to argue with them, where there’s a real risk of severing the bond you have.

One way to minimise this discomfort is to sever ties with whatever, or whoever, is causing it.

Like so many people with a warped view of the world (psychics, alt-med sellers, etc), conspiracy theorists are generally “true believers”, and are convinced of the truth of the ideas they propagate. They often feel that it is important to convince other people of the truth of their ideas. Many conspiracy theories involve not just governments lying to us (about the moon landings or 9/11) but actively harming us, as is the case with chemtrails, vaccines, water fluoridation and the like - so it can becomes important for believers to help save others by convincing them that their welfare, or even their life, is at risk.")]),e._v(" "),o("p",[e._v("So, if you’re comfortable that you’re not going to be shunned or disinherited by speaking up, what can you do?")]),e._v(" "),o("p",[e._v("One tactic is to choose a single topic and look into it together - mercury in vaccines, or FEMA camps maybe.

Many of these people also have regressive views on women’s rights, so it’s a good way to show women the downside of following them.
