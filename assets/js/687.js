Usually with Ponzi schemes lies are told to potential investors about the interest they could make from investing their money in the scheme. However, although they may have been told that their money has increased in worth, in reality the money is either sitting in a bank somewhere making little to no interest, or has been spent on buying the scheme’s creator a shiny new Porsche. The biggest problem for someone running a Ponzi scheme is that some people will eventually want to cash out their money, including the profits they’ve been promised. The scammer will often try to convince the investors to keep their money in the scheme, either by reminding them of the amazing profits their money is making them or by offering them an exclusive new tier of investing with even higher margins.

Well, Bitcoin is a very volatile currency that is currently being used more for speculation and to make a profit quickly than to actually pay for goods and services.

Like Ponzi schemes, some people will make money from investing and divesting at the right time, and many more will lose out by not cashing out in time.

What used to be simple to do with a computer’s CPU, its brain, eventually used more money in electricity to create than the coin was worth.

As a result of this, bitcoin mining is becoming bad for the environment. I’ve talked to Siouxsie Wiles’ husband about this before - he’s an expert in cryptographic systems - and he suggested that mining really should have been linked to useful CPU work rather than just churning almost for the sake of it, and wasting huge amounts of electricity.
