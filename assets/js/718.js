Like OneCoin, EvoRich involves dodgy Russian "businessmen", multi level marketing, the promise of a cryptocurrency with absolutely no evidence that it actually exists, slick looking websites that show you your "investment" going up in value, and lots of training on how to bring your friends in to invest in the scheme. However I have a strong suspicion, even though it’s very easy to buy into EvoRich, that it’ll be impossible for people to take their money out again.

Well, you can’t tell a skeptic not to open the URL and expect them to listen to you! So I typed in a couple of different URLs from the video to my browser, and the second one took me to the demo site’s API - it’s a part of a website where software can ask a server for data. Although the site needed credentials to login, I could see that it was written in Yii - a popular web framework written in the PHP language for building websites and APIs. And the developers of the site had left debug mode on, which meant that all requests to the site were being logged, and there was a convenient link to the logs. When I clicked the link, it showed me all the traffic that the API had received over the last few months. It wasn’t much, but there were a few POST requests to the /login page - and as a web developer it was obvious to me that these were login attempts. Those attempts appear to have been made by EvoRich "consultants" who accidentally tried to use the demo site to login, rather than the live site. In the logs I was able to see people’s cleartext usernames and passwords - not an admin account, but the login credentials of different people from around the world who have been conned by this company.')]),e._v(" "),o("p",[e._v("I’ve let the company know that they have a security issue (through their email address of ethics@evo-rich.com) so that they can fix it.
