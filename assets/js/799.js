The article talked about an IT engineer called Rob Willis who started work for an unnamed company back in 2015. Rob was tasked with setting up a social media wing of the company, posting regular news articles to the company’s website and other places. But after a while the kinds of stories he was asked to post  - chemtrails, the healing properties of lemons - were supplemented with political stories. The tactics changed as well, using techniques such as astroturfing - which is creating the illusion of a grassroots movement. This involves setting up lots of websites, Facebook groups, Twitter accounts, etc to make the original website’s messaging look more authentic and widespread. They also carefully chose what time of day to post different kinds of news stories, in order  to maximise engagement - an upbeat item in the morning, the day’s big story at 11am, and fringe conspiracy content late in the evening. The political stories also started to change, being less about the evils of government and more about the evils of Hillary Clinton and the genius of Donald Trump. Rob managed to increase the website’s reach to cover 30 million people a week, before he eventually quit in 2017.")]),e._v(" "),t("p",[e._v("Well, now a "),t("a",{attrs:{href:"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/10/disinformation-guru-hacker-x-names-his-employer-naturalnews-com/",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"}},[e._v("follow-up article"),t("OutboundLink")],1),e._v(" from Ars Technica has named the company behind this massive misinformation campaign - and, surprise surprise, it was Mike Adams’ Natural News.
