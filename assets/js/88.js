Yes, on average rock layers are laid down very slowly, with a metre of rock taking millions of years.

Scientists know that fossils are made when animals are buried in single events, such as land slips (both on land and underwater), large underwater sediment deposits, sinking into tar pits, etc. I’ve seen this argument used before, by another Australian creationist called John Mackay, and it’s sad to see this kind of deception used.")]),e._v(" "),s("p",[e._v("Here’s me talking with Rod about radio dating methods.")]),e._v(" "),s("p",[s("img",{attrs:{src:a(531),alt:"Chatting"}})]),e._v(" "),s("p",[e._v("The end of the talk was a cringeworthy double whammy.
