Any unproven therapeutic treatment should be tested first in controlled conditions to ensure that it works, and only when proven to work should it be used on patients - and this approach should apply to other animals the same as it does to humans. Trying out multiple unproven therapies on a wild animal requiring treatment seems cruel - apart from anything else, there's no way to monitor the long term health of the animal as it will need to be set free, unlike captive animals who can be monitored easily. It would have been much kinder to have allowed a conventional veterinarian to treat the bears with the best that science has to offer. This approach appears to have been used as a way to raise the profile of the department at the university.
