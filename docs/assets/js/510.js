Presumably, although this is not referenced, he's referring to census results showing more kiwis becoming irreligious. But to confuse a lack of belief with apathy is wrong. I know a fair few atheists, and many of them have a keen interest in spirituality - they just don't believe that a spiritual realm is real. Atheists tend to know more about a wide range of religious beliefs than religious people do, and active skepticism (asking questions about whether beliefs are true) is a component of many people's atheism.

This is something I've heard from Christians before, the idea that atheists still believe in god somewhere deep down, but try to deny him because of their hatred of him. Dawkins doesn't talk about hating god, he talks about how the character of god as described by Christians and other religious groups is not a positive thing, and how religious people often do bad things in the name of their god. None of that means that Dawkins hates god - he simply hates the things done in the name of god.

Of course, it's a stretch for Geoff to talk about the beliefs of the billions of Christians in the world as if they're all in accord - and I for one have certainly met Christians who are proud of the fact that they have beliefs that defy evidence - that god can perform miracles where there is no evidence that the miracles actually happened, or that their belief in the absence of evidence is a way to show their devotion to their chosen religion.
