At University we were tasked with creating a web page on the topic of patterns of innovation. I still have a copy of the page, and it shows a less than auspicious start to my website creating days!

<!-- more -->

From the looks of the header, I simply created a Microsoft Word document and exported it as a web page!

```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN">
<META http-equiv=Content-Type content="text/html; charset=iso-8859-1">
<META content="MSHTML 6.00.2716.2200" name=GENERATOR></HEAD>
```

Anyway, here's the page in all its glory:

<iframe style="width: 100%; height: 1000px;" src="/pages/first/" />
