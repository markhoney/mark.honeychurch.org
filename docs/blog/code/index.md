title: Code I've written, and more

Over the years I've written some bad code, and some okay code. But one constant is that I've always enjoyed writing code, and always enjoyed the challenge of learning new languages and libraries.

I guess I started learning to code at primary school with [Logo](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)>), before dabbling with [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC) in secondary school. At University I learned [Pascal](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)>) and [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B).

Since then I've learned, to varying degrees of competence (and in roughly chronological order): [VBA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_for_Applications), [Perl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl), [PHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP), [KiXtart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KiXtart), [Rexx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rexx), [Python](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)>), [C](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)>), [C#](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)>), [Javascript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript).

A lot of [my code](https://github.com/markhoney) is on GitHub. Here are write-ups of some of the projects I've worked on, and some of my thoughts on coding and other people's code:
