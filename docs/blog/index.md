Although I don't write much, I've blogged a little on and off over the years. I've also jotted down my thoughts on weird and wonderful topics as and when inspiration hits me, and documented various home tech projects. I'm lucky enough to have a regular slot on the radio here in New Zealand as well, and my preparation for that means that I often write down my thoughts on topics of interest to skeptics.
