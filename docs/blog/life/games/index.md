I don't play computer games very often, as it often feels like wasted time that could have been more productively spent elsewhere. However, I've come round to the idea that games can be used as down time, and that it's okay sometimes to just take time off and relax with a controller in hand. Funnily, a lot of the games I enjoy playing probably aren't considered relaxing. I tend to choose games that require a lot of thought - not strategy games but puzzlers, and also games that are artistic or different to the mainstream.

So, here's a list of the games I've found myself enjoying over the last few years - they range from those that I've found myself coming back to again and again (Viscera Cleanup Detail), to those that surprise me with their novelty or storyline (What Remains of Edith Finch) and those that just blow me away with their innovation and style (Death Stranding). I've roughly broken them down by genre, but there's some overlap.

## Puzzle - single player

### Braid

I think Braid may have been the earliest puzzle game I played that really had an interesting twist. It's one of several puzzle games that I really like that involve manipulating time.

### The Talos Principle

I liked The Talos Principle when I first purchased it because it ran well at 1080p on my HTPC graphics card, a lowly NVidia GT 520. The puzzles were difficult enough to be a real challenge as well.

### The Gardens Between

This game had a fun way of playing with time, and I didn't mind too much that it was on rails.

### The Room series

The Room games have been really fun to play as a family, with everyone making suggestions about what to try and enjoying the mysterious feel of the games.

### Portal 1 & 2

Both the Portal Games (and their predecessor, Narbacular Drop) have a really interesting, simple mechanic that gets you thinking laterally to solve puzzles.

### The Unfinished Swan

The Unfinished Swan's simple concept of making everyting totally white and having to use paint splats to see the landscape looks gorgeous.
