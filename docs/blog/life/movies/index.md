Following on from the list of my [favourite games](../games), I figured it would be interesting to write down my favourite movies, along with a sentence or two about why I like them so much.

<!-- more -->

## After the Wedding

## Arrival

## Audience of One

## Being John Malkovich

## Birdman

## Blade Runner

## Children of Men

## Citizenfour

## City Hunter

## A Clockwork Orange

## Cloud Atlas

The scope of this movie always blows me away. It's beautiful, covers an exansive time period and has many interesting threads running through it. The re-use of actors, which would feel like a gimmick in most movies, works well in this context.

## Colossal

## The Congress

## Constantine

## District 9

## Donnie Darko

## Eat Drink Man Woman

## Edge of Tomorrow

I don't want to like this movie - after all, it has Scientologist Tom Cruise in it - but somehow I can't get over the fact that he's a great actor.

## Equilibrium

Although flawed, and with a fairly generic storyline, this movie had some great fight scenes.

## Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind

## Eyes Wide Shut

## The Fifth Element

## Four Lions

## Gattaca

## The Handmaiden

## Hanna

## Her

## An Honest Liar

## The Host

## Human Traffic

A movie that captured a moment. Human Traffic chronicled a fictional weekend in the lives of a group of clubbers, and did it in a refreshing storytelling fashion. Plus the soundtrack is banging!

## In My Father's Den

A sad, serious, depressing New Zealand movie about love and abuse. What's not to like!

## Japanese Story

A sad, serious, depressing Australian movie about love and death. What's not to like!

## Jodorowsky's Dune

I'm conflicted as to whether Jodorowsky's vision of Dune should have ever seen the light of day. There's a good chance he would have made something god-awful, but the glimpses we are given in this documentary are, at the least, intriguing.

## Juno

## La La Land

I'm not a fan of musicals, and this one, although better than most, didn't blow me away - except for the montage at the end. That 5 minutes alone made the movie something special for me.

## Lars and the Real Girl

## the Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

## The Lobster

## Lost in Translation

## Mad Max: Fury Road

## Magic in the Moonlight

An old friend had me watch this movie, as she told me the skepticism in it reminded her of me. I really like how the movie portrayed skepticism as a very human pursuit - one with lofty goals, but practiced by flawed people who are liable to make mistakes. Nobody's perfect!

## MAgnolia

## The Man from Earth

## The Man who Wasn't There

## The Martian

## Marwencol

## Meet Joe Black

## Moon

## Mulholland Drive

## Muriel's Wedding

## O Brother, Where Art Thou

## Oblivion

Another Tom Cruise science fiction movie that it solidly made, with some great performances.

## Passengers

## Prevenge

## The Quiet Earth

## The Remains of the Day

## Reservoir Dogs

## Resurrect Dead: The Mystery of the Toynbee Tiles

## The Royal Tenenbaums

## Run Lola Run

## Scott Pilgrim vs. the world

## Secretary

## Sideways

## Spotlight

## Sucker Punch

## Three Colours: Red

## Trainspotting

## Twelve Monkeys

## Upstream Color

## The Usual Suspects

## V for Vendetta

## Waru

## Watchmen

## Weiner

## Whiplash

## White Men Can't Jump

## Witch Hunt

## Withnail & I

## the World's Fastest Indian

## Zero Days

## Zombieland
