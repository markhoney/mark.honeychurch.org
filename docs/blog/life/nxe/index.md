I applied for the beta program for Microsoft's [New XBox Experience](http://www.xbox.com/en-us/live/nxe/) and received an acceptance email today. Hopefully the new dashboard will be available for download tomorrow, so I'll have that and the new version of [Ubuntu](http://ubuntu.com/)/[Mythbuntu](http://www.mythbuntu.org/) to download. Below is my acceptance email, as my way of gloating!

Also, all weird formatting in this email was in the source. This includes spaces at the beginning of paragraphs, double spaces around certain words or phrases (which appear to be where variables have been programmatically substituted with text) and raw html characters (&amp;quot; instead of a double quote, ")
