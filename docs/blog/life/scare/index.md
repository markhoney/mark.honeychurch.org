The pictures are a little blurry, so here's some of what they say:

>
> "Who's going to pay your medical bills if you break your leg"
>
> "Tell them about recent customers who got typhoid..."

### Ask for the Cash $$

> "Give them time to express any ideas or concerns they have before saying... - does this sound like you?"
>
> "Ask 'yes' questions..."
>
> "Shall we get this all sorted then?"
