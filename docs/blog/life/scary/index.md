I've just received a silly spam email that is a little different to anything I've received before. This one is nefarious enough that I could imagine some people being scared enough that they end up sending money to the doofus at the other end. I'm guessing that the list of emails they're using is pretty old, as they tell me how many UK pounds I need to pay and I've not lived in England for 12 years now.

Anway, here's the scary email in full:

> From: Rahul Manoj julia@asroc.com
>
> I guess you’re wondering why you’re receiving this email right?
>
> It would be highly beneficial to your privacy if you didn’t ignore it.
>
> I have placed a Malware on an adult website (…P…0…r…n site) and as you visited and watched the video your device has been affected, placing a spyware on your machine. Which has recorded you both with webcam and screen capture while you had your “fun Time” allowing me to see exactly what you see.
>
> This has also affected your smartphone via an exploit. So do not think for one minute you can circumvent this by reinstalling your OS. You have already been recorded.
>
> After that my malware collected all your messengers, emails and social networks contacts.
>
> I guess this isn’t good news right?
>
> But don’t worry too much, there’s a way we can fix this privacy issue. All i require is a Bitcoin payment of £ 850 which i think is a fair price considering the circumstances.
>
> The address to make the payment is: 333vDCcYipberH4wKgMnXppaBeauRPoNH7
>
> If you don’t understand bitcoin, go on youtube and search for “how to buy bitcoin” or google for “localbitcoins”, its pretty easy to do it.
>
> You have only 48 hours after reading this e-mail to send payment (Be warned i know when you have opened and read this email, i have placed a pixel image inside it. Which enables me to know when you have opened the messaged on exactly what day and time)
>
> If you decide to ignore this email, i will have no choice but to forward the video to all the collected contacts you have on your email account, as well as post on your social media accounts, and send as a personal message to all Facebook contacts. and of course make the video publicly available on internet, via you-tube and adult websites. considering your reputation, i highly doubt you want to be exposed to your family/friends/coworkers during this current time.
>
> You can actually go to the police, but these people will not likely do anything, the most significant stuff they can do is lock my wallet and you will deprive other people from the opportunity to pay me. So think twice before doing foolish things.
>
> If i receive payment all the material will be destroyed and you will never hear from me again. If i do not get my funds for virtually any reason, such as the inability to send cash to a blacklisted wallet – your reputation is going to be wrecked. So make it fast.
>
> Do not try to make contact with me because am using a victim email that was hacked and exposed.
>
> If you don't believe and want proof just reply to this email with “PROOF” and i will send your video to 5 of your contacts via email, and post on your Facebook wall. In which you will be able to remove it once, not forever.
