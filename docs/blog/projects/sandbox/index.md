At [CoderDojo](http://coderdojo.nz/) we walked the kids through building an [AR sandbox](http://idav.ucdavis.edu/~okreylos/ResDev/SARndbox/).

The project was a lesson in bad User Interface design, as the people at UC Davis who built the software obviously didn't have much of an idea how to make a piece of software user friendly. Despite that, after a few hours and a couple of beers three of us IT professionals managed to get the thing running.
