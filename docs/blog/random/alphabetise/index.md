I read a simple, obvious, but strange thought on the internet the other day, that the order of letters in the alphabet is, to some extent at least, arbitrary. I'm sure there are historical reasons why the alphabet is currently organised like it is, but it got me wondering if there might be a better way to organise things to make it easier to learn and use.

## Vowels

Starting with the vowels, I can't think of a good reason to have them spread out the way they are. Maybe they'd be better off all being moved to the start of the alphabet? Let's see how that looks:

AEIOU BCDFGHJKLMNPQRSTVWXYZ

## Sounds

Maybe there's a way of grouping sounds together that might make things a little more logical? For example, B and D sound similar, as do F and V. Maybe there's a way of organising the letters so that they start with sounds made at the back of the throat (like H), and move forwards to sounds made at the front of the mouth (like T). Let's sort the sounds roughly from the back of the throat to the front, starting with the vowels, and keeping the groups in alphabetical order here:

AEIOU CGH JMQ DKLNRW FVY BP STX
