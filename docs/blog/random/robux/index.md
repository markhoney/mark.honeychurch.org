My eldest daughter is a bit of an addict when it comes to the online game Roblox - in fact, all three of my daughters like playing the game. Recently my eldest daughter started getting spammed with in-game messages telling her to visit a URL to get free Robux. Robux is the in-game currency for buying accessories, outfits, etc, and can be purchased with real money. In this case, the URL was short and simple to type in:

<!-- more -->

[robux.me](http://robux.me/)

My daughter opened the URL in a browser and then came to me asking what she should do next. I told her to close the URL and not visit it again, but I could tell that the lure of free currency was too much for her. She seemed disappointed that she was going to miss out on free stuff, and didn't believe me that she should stay away from the offer simply because I'd said it wasn't real.

So, I sat her down next to me and went through signing up for free Robux in an incognito window on my laptop.

We used a made up email address on honeychurch.org (afhsdkghsfkgd@honeychurch.org was chosen by bashing on the keyboard), as I have a catch-all redirect for all unknown addresses at honeychurch.org to be redirected to my mailbox.

She watched as I filled in form after form, giving over more and more personal information (a mixture of real and faked), and all without ever getting to the point where I was awarded my free Robux. More and more windows were opening, and the completion of each form led to the opening of a new one.

Then after about 5 minutes, we checked my spam folder. Lo and behold, I was already receiving spam emails addressed to the fake address:

I made it fun, showing her just how daft it all was. I talked about how I'd given over enough information that someone could pretend to be me, and in return all I got was a mailbox full of spam - and that the spam emails were just phishing for more information, trying to get me to click on links in the hope that I have an insecure browser that will allow them to infect my PC with malware.

Hopefully the lesson sank in.
