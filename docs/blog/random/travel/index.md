I've spent some time travelling around a few parts of the world, although there's a lot more to see! Here are some visas from countries I've visited, in the order that I first visited them and grouped by journey, as most of my travelling has been done in long trips:

::: tab Nepal

Unfortunately my passport was stolen just after crossing from Nepal into India, so this is all I have:

::: tab India

In India we had problems getting accommodation, due to the lack of a valid visa because my passport was stolen. This is the solution that immigration came up with:

## 2004 - 2005

:::: tabs

::: tab Greece

I entered Greece on my UK passport, so there was no visa requirement and no stamping of my passport.

::: tab Turkey

::: tab Georgia

Although our original Iranian visa was for one month, it was cheap and easy to then extend this for another month:

## 2005 - Now

:::: tabs

::: tab "New Zealand"

I arrived in New Zealand on a one year Holiday Working visa:

After a year, I transitioned to a sponsored Work visa, working for Telecom (now Spark):

This was closely followed by a Returning Residence visa:

Now I'm a New Zealand citizen, as can be seen from the change of passport when I visited South Africa.
