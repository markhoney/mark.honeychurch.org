The Dalai Lama has [spoken about his successor](http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2015/09/24/dalai-lama-women-attractive_n_8186726.html), and suggested that if it's a woman, they would have to be attractive.

> "If female Dalai Lama did come, then that female must be very attractive. Otherwise not much use."

He has previously said:

> "If she is an ugly female, she won't be very effective, will she?"
