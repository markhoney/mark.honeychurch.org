A [blood moon](http://www.express.co.uk/news/weird/584602/Rare-Blood-Moon-September-huge-earth-destroying-earthquakes-prophets-warn-USA-pope) is a new name for a lunar eclipse, where the earth travels between the sun and the moon. The full moon turns red.

[April Eclipse](http://rasnz.org.nz/in-the-sky/eclipses) was visible April 5th, 1am. This one is visible from South America, 70 minutes.

The second coming of Jesus is upon us, or at least that's what a couple of US preachers are saying. The latest of 4 blood moons may well be a portent of the beginning of the end.

A [Timaru group](http://www.stuff.co.nz/timaru-herald/news/71699115/september-blood-moon-sparks-fears-of-apocalyptic-event) are preparing for the event.

group member Patricia Hughes believes "something probably will happen".

> "I think in September lots of things will happen ... maybe financial collapse,"

> "I'm trying to stock up a bit of food just in case."

the [Mormon Church has issued a statement](http://www.stuff.co.nz/world/americas/72444838/blood-moon-seen-as-sign-of-end-times-by-some-mormons) cautioning the faithful to not get caught up in speculation about a major calamity.

Mormon author Julie Rowe says "that time has come" for tragic upcoming world calamities shown to her during an NDE.

This is the culmination of events that started on the 23rd of September:
