Stuff [published an article](http://www.stuff.co.nz/marlborough-express/news/72011849/double-lung-transplant-gives-hope) last week about Tamaha McDonald, from Blenheim, who is currently living in Mexico. Tamaha's wife, Jennifer, suffers from a lung condition which means that she needs a double lung transplant. They are currently raising money to help with this.

A week later, Stuff [published a follow up article](http://www.stuff.co.nz/oddstuff/72198514/jesus-brain-scan-a-miracle). In it, Tamaha says that a scan taken of his wife's brain back in 2013 contains an image of Jesus and that this "represents a miracle."

This appears to be a case of pareidolia, where our brains are very good at seeing patterns in noise, especially recognising faces.
