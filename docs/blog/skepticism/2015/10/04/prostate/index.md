> Frustrated by misinformation and a lack of medical emphasis on clinically-proven natural preventative treatments, Mr Matthews speaks frankly with men about the pros and cons of the digital prostate exam and other interventions

This was [published uncritically](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&objectid=11520264) by the NZ Herald, but the [source is a naturopath](http://www.xtend-life.com/news-blog/blog/articles/prostate-health-sex-lies-and-misconceptions), Warren Matthews.

Warren appears to have no relevant qualifications. He recommends buying several of his supplementation tablets, and also recommends prostate massage if you don't have sex.

> If a man does not have regular sex or ejaculation, then the prostatic fluid remaining in the prostate will become stagnant as will any 'pocket' of static fluid in the body. It may become a breeding ground for bacteria and viruses.

Wikipedia says:

> prostate massage is not officially sanctioned in [western medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_medicine) for the treatment of any medical disorder today
