> During the recent visit of Pope Francis to the United States, in every city he visited, (Washington DC, New York City and Philadelphia,) there were people at the fringes of the largest crowds wearing bright yellow shirts, often carrying large yellow signs, handing out literature proclaiming the end of the world for October 7, 2015 from eBible Fellowship, led by Chris McCann.

Their reasoning is:

- "10,000 days" since God began judgment on the house of God, the churches of the world, on May 21, 1988
- The "1,600^th^ day" since God began judgment on the world on May 21, 2011; it would be the "40^th^" forty
- the last day of the Feast of Harvest, which God relates to the end of the world.
- "the last day" of the Feast of Tabernacles

We had this a few weeks ago with the blood moon, so it's surprising to see it again so soon.

Of course, no end of the world happened.

### October 8th

> Dear friends,

> For some time now E Bible Fellowship (and myself) have been looking towards October 7<sup>th</sup> as the likely end of the world. We believed there was a strong likelihood that God would complete His judgment and bring about the world's destruction on that day. There was much biblical information pointing to this date and we freely shared it with all. Yet, consistently stressing throughout the entire time period that the world ending on that date was a "strong likelihood." Since it is now October 8<sup>th</sup> it is now obvious that we were incorrect regarding the world's ending on the 7<sup>th</sup>.

> Did We Lie?

> No. The fact is that we consistently told people that October 7<sup>th</sup>, 2015 (being the end of the world) was a strong likelihood. And according to the good amount of biblical evidence at our disposal it was. Therefore saying it was a "strong likelihood" was a true statement. We also openly acknowledged that there was a small likelihood that it would not happen. There was no lie or deceitfulness involved in any way.
