[House Network](http://www.housenetwork.co.uk/ghost_free_service.asp) in the UK is offering a [ghost-free home certification](http://www.cnet.com/news/real-estate-service-offers-ghost-free-home-certification/) service, and they point to a report that says that:

> Houses can sell for up to 20% less than market value, and twice as hard to sell, if they're thought to be haunted. I wonder how much less it can be when they're not haunted?
