> Reiki is a form of [alternative medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine) developed in 1922 by Japanese Buddhist [Mikao Usui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikao_Usui) Since its beginning in Japan, Reiki has been adapted across varying cultural traditions. It uses a technique commonly called palm healing or hands-on-healing. Through the use of this technique, practitioners believe that they are transferring "universal energy" through the palms of the practitioner, which they believe encourages healing.

They last advertised [the same role](http://www.isciencemag.co.uk/blog/reiki-really/) in 2011.

> Professor Edzard Ernst, the world's first, and only, professor of complementary medicine said "We have published a systematic review of reikiâ€¦the evidence is simply not there. There are a number of studies, they are flimsy and the ones that are rigorous don't generate a positive result. In my book the evidence is even negative,"
