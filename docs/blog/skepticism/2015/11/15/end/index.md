There has been a major end of the world prediction about every 100 years or so from 66AD onwards. Then from 1500AD (16th Century) every 10 years, then by the 1970s pretty much every year.

> The end of all things is near. Therefore be alert and of sober mind so that you may pray.

1 Peter 4:7

## Jehovah's Witnesses

[1914](http://www.jwfacts.com/watchtower/failed-1914-predictions.php)

> "bear in mind that the end of 1914 is not the date for the beginning, but for the end of the time of trouble."

_Zion's Watch Tower_ 1894 Jul 15 p.226

[1975](http://www.jwfacts.com/watchtower/1975.php)

Lots of hinting about the end of the world. People told not to buy property, etc.

From 1966:

> "six thousand years from man's creation will end in 1975, and the seventh period of a thousand years of human history will begin in the fall of 1975"

> don't any of you be specific in saying anything that is going to happen between now and 1975. But the big point of it all is this, dear friends: Time is short. Time is running out, no question about that."

_Watchtower_ 1966

> "we don't have to guess what the year 1975 means if we read the Watchtower. And don't wait 'till 1975. The door is going to be shut before then. As one brother put it,"

Stay alive to Seventy-Five

> "If you are a young person, you also need to face the fact that you will never grow old in this present system of things. Why not? Because all the evidence in fulfillment of Bible prophecy indicates that this corrupt system is due to end in a few years."

_Awake!1969_ May 22 p.15

> "there is the thrilling hope of a grand relief"

> "Reports are heard of brothers selling their homes and property"

## [Adventists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventism)

> Adventism is a branch of Protestantism which began in the 19th century in the context of the Second Great Awakening revival in the United States. The name refers to belief in the imminent Second Coming (or "Second Advent") of Jesus Christ.

> "The Seventh-day Adventist Church arose from the [Millerite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millerism) movement of the 1840s in upstate [New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York), a phase of the [Second Great Awakening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Great_Awakening). [William Miller](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Miller_(preacher)>) predicted on the basis of [Daniel 8:14â€“16](http://tools.wmflabs.org/bibleversefinder/?book=Daniel&verse=8:14%E2%80%9316&src=KJV) and the "[day-year principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day-year_principle)" that [Jesus Christ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_Christ) would return to Earth between the spring of 1843 and the spring of 1844"

What that didn't happen, the fallout was called the [Great Disappointment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Disappointment)

April 18 and then October 22 were predicted - nothing. Some:

- waited
- predicted April, July, and October 1845
- thought the "Great Sabbath" had come, and they could stop working
- Acted like kids because:
  - "Truly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it."
- tried to pray down Jesus from a white cloud

Most quit the church, many joining the Shakers

Millions of Seventh day Adventists still pray for the end of the world!

  - Carbon dioxide levels fall to the point at which C4 photosynthesis is no longer possible. Free oxygen and ozone disappear from the atmosphere. Multicellular life dies out.

  - With the hydrogen supply exhausted at its core, the Sun leaves the main sequence and begins to evolve into a red giant.
  - The Earth and Moon are very likely destroyed by falling into the Sun, just before the Sun reaches the tip of its red giant phase and its maximum radius of 256 times the present day value. Before the final collision, the Moon possibly spirals below Earth's Roche limit, breaking into a ring of debris, most of which falls to the Earth's surface.
