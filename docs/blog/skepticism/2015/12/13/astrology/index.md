The Wellington Astrology centre, a drop-in office in central Wellington, is struggling to make ends meet and has turned to Pledge Me to [raise funds](https://www.pledgeme.co.nz/projects/4312-save-the-welington-astrology-centre). It's been running since 2011, but now needs $3,000 to cover the next 3 months of bills.

Fundraising closes on the 4th of January, and they've raised $625 of the hoped $3000 in the first 13 days, with 22 days left to go.
