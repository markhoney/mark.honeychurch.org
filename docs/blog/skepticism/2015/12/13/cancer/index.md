> "he used the Bible to battle against radiation side effects"

> "God, You divided light from the darkness, the day from the night, You directed David's stone out of his slingshot. Now, I ask that you to direct this radiation. If there are cancer cells in my body, let it attack the cancer cells and let there be no side effect left in my body."

> "Whatever medication I take, I stand against any side effects. I say, "This medication will do exactly what God and my doctors purpose it to do, and will harm me in no way." The Bible says, Mark 16â€”and I've stood on this, "If they drink any deadly thing, it shall not harm them," meaning whatever comes in to my body to help bring healing will not harm me, for I'm a child of God."

Like Benny Hinn

Andy Kubala, from Christchurch, is a faith healer. He claims that as a kid he was healed of leukaemia by god, but mentions in passing the hundreds of thousands of dollars of medical treatment he received from NZ. He now lives in Australia.
