Up to 80 kids - 1 in 4 - at Brunswick North West Primary School in Melbourne have [contracted chicken pox](http://www.stuff.co.nz/world/australia/74981701/eighty-children-get-chickenpox-at-school-that-calls-for-tolerance-of-vaccine-dodgers). The school is tolerant or even welcoming of parents who choose not to vaccinate their kids. Newsletters have reiterated this view:

> "Staff respect the rights of every family to make choices about immunisation and we will definitely not exclude children who are not fully immunised from our service,"

> "We expect all community members to act respectfully and with tolerance when interacting with other parents and carers who may have a differing opinion to their own. This includes an opposing understanding about child immunisation. In many aspects of our school life, we accommodate a range of opinions and beliefs from the parent community"

The chickenpox vaccine is [offered for free](http://www.immunise.health.gov.au/internet/immunise/publishing.nsf/Content/immunise-varicella) as part of the [Australian vaccination schedule](http://www.immunise.health.gov.au/internet/immunise/publishing.nsf/Content/nips).

Australia has a "no jab no play" policy, but just for pre-schoolers.
