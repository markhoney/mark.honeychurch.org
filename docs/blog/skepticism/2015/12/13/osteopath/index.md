An osteopath in Christchurch [has been disciplined](http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/74844622/disciplined-osteopath-george-mckenzie-yet-to-apologise) for treating a patient's toothache by touching her breast.

He said that tightness in her chest muscles was causing problems with her jaw.

This is the second time this osteopath has been disciplined for similar behaviour.

I've looked through the history of Health and Disability Commissioner complaints, and a surprising number are related to alternative health practitioners. I wonder if a lack of professional training, including coaching on acceptable behaviour, is to blame in at least some of these cases.
