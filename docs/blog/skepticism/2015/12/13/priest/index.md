A [website](http://helpsfdchantal.weebly.com/) and [FB page](https://www.facebook.com/Remove-Fr-Peter-Miqueli-as-Pastor-of-St-Frances-de-Chantal-213413205520342/) are calling for his resignation.

He [stepped down](http://pix11.com/2015/12/12/bronx-reverend-peter-miqueli-steps-down-after-being-sued-for-allegedly-stealing-church-donations/) in the last few hours:

At his previous church, he signed the church owned house over to himself and took the parish jeep.
