David Icke was last in NZ in 2011. He'll [talk in Auckland](http://theworldwidewakeup.consciousevents.co.za/?product=david-icke-live-at-the-logan-campell-centre-auckland) about his new book (surprise, surprise!), lizards, the illuminati and [many other nonsense subjects](https://chemtrailsnorthnz.wordpress.com/2016/02/07/david-icke-coming-to-auckland-in-august/#more-16016).

David used to be a goalkeeper and then a sports commentator, until he announced on British TV in the early 90's that he was the son of God. Since then, he's expanded his ideas and currently ties together many different conspiracy theories into his world view, and sees it as his life's mission to tell everyone about it.
