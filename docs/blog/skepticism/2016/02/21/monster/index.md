Yet another sea monster [has been found](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&objectid=11590644), this time in Swansea, NSW, Australia. Ethan Tipper posted the photo on Facebook, asking "What the f\*\*\* is this?".

Many alleged sea monsters are partially decomposed basking sharks (very large sharks) and other large fish and mammals. In this instance, an expert has identified the animal as a pike eel.

In 2013 a sea monster that [washed ashore on Tauranga beach](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10882631) was identified as a badly rotted killer whale corpse.
