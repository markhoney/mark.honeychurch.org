Shane Warne is currently appearing on Australia's version of I'm A Celebrity ... Get Me Out Of Here!. He [announced on the show](http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/cricket/76923096/shane-warne-believes-alien-experiments-turned-monkeys-into-humans) that [he thinks](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&objectid=11590197) aliens created the pyramids in Egypt, and that they also engineered humans:

Whatever planet they're on out there, they decided that they were gonna start more life here on earth and study us. Maybe they turned a few monkeys into humans and said, 'yeah, it works'."
