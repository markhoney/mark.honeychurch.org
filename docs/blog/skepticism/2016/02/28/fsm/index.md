After the [Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster](http://www.venganza.org/) successfully applied for the ability to register marriage celebrants last year, their first celebrant has [now been approved](http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/77306457/NZ-gets-its-first-Flying-Spaghetti-Monster-marriage-celebrant). Karen Martyn is willing to travel to anywhere in the country to perform a pastafarian wedding ceremony.

The serious point of these efforts, including Russell in Christchurch's driver's license where he's wearing a colander, is to point out the inequality of religious privilege in New Zealand. other countries where people have IDs wearing a colander include Australia, the US, Belgium, Czech Republic and Russia.

Here's a pastafarian wedding at Burning Man in the US:

The idea was created by Bobby Henderson in 2005, who wrote a letter protesting the teaching of intelligent design in Kansas schools. He argued that his idea of a flying spaghetti monster fiddling with radiocarbon dating results was as valid and believable as ID, and deserved equal teaching time. The next year, a new school board was voted in and the changes reversed.

There is a book available called "The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster"

Their beliefs are:

- Flying Spaghetti Monster created the universe "after drinking heavily"
- Beer volcano and stripper factory in heaven
- Humans evolved from pirates, not primates
- A lack of pirates is causing global warming
- Fridays are holy days
- Main religious holiday is called "Holiday"
