A new trend started recently, when IV "hydration" clinics opened in Australia late last year, called [iv.me](http://www.ivmeaustralia.com.au/) and the [Hangover Clinic](http://www.hangover.clinic/). The clinics offer customers a range of treatments, consisting of IV drips with various mixes of saline, vitamins, painkillers and oxygen.

There's no evidence that these actually help with a hangover, or can help with any other condition that they're being advertised for:

Claims of energising, anti-ageing, treating colds/flus and detoxing - and an all-in-one for $350.

Several clinics are [now up and running](http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/health/health-problems/the-hangover-clinic-prepares-to-open-up-in-sydney/news-story/590c272ae8900c58b348a33e24c2d192) in Australia, although in recent news the Sydney iv.me clinic has [already been closed](http://www.stuff.co.nz/world/australia/77346037/Sydney-IV-ME-clinic-closed-after-client-hospitalised) for hospitalising a customer, pending a full review. The customer suffered from "fever, abdominal pains and low blood pressure".

Let's hope the trend doesn't reach our shores.
