Submissions are closing next week for the [Natural Health and Supplementary Products bill](http://www.parliament.nz/en-nz/pb/legislation/bills/00DBHOH_BILL11034_1/natural-health-and-supplementary-products-bill), which seeks to regulate alternative medicine. Although there are several issues, such as the use of "historical evidence" being allowed, the bill in general is positive. People are encouraged to read the bill and make a submission.

Many alt-med groups are talking about how bad the bill is, and [using scaremongering](https://www.change.org/p/naturalhealthproducts-moh-govt-nz-keep-access-to-nutrients-in-nz-that-have-a-proven-safety-record-and-therapeutic-benefit) to recommend that people write in submissions opposing the bill.

The NZ Skeptics will be making a submission supporting the bill, with some suggestions on how to strengthen its consumer protections.
