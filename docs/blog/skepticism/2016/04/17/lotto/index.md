The NZ Herald [published a list](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11623223) of the top 5 luckiest stores, and went so far as to claim that your chances of winning the lottery would increase if you visit one of these stores!

Of course, there is variation in statistics, but none of these stores show any variation beyond what we would expect - the list didn't even take into consideration the number of tickets sold - just the number of "First Division winning tickets"
