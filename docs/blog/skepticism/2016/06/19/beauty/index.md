Consumer NZ [used secret shoppers](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&objectid=11657183) to visit 46 NZ beauty clinics with a raised skin spot. The issue was such that the undercover person should have been referred to a GP, but 7 of the 46 clinics said that they were able to treat the problem themselves, with lasers, electrocution, needling or cutting.

Sue Chetwin from Consumer NZ said:

> "Given New Zealand's high skin cancer rate, we think beauty therapists should steer clear of this type of treatment and leave diagnosis to the doctors."
