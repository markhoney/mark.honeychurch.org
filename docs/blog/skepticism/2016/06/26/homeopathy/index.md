A [petition on change.org](https://www.change.org/p/the-royal-college-of-veterinary-surgeons-a-call-to-ban-veterinary-surgeons-from-prescribing-homeopathy-as-a-treatment-for-animals) has been [signed by 1,000 vets](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2016/06/24/homeopathy-can-kill-pets-and-should-be-banned-say-vets/) asking for the UK to blacklist homeopathy as a treatment that vets can prescribe for animals. Over 2,500 people have signed it in all.

Danny Chambers from Edinburgh Uni, who started the petition, said:

> "The danger is not only due to the remedies being ineffective, but the belief held by some homeopaths that such therapies can be a substitute for orthodox treatment."

> "Vets who practice homeopathy should not be permitted to use their professional standing to promote its validity. They should not be allowed to charge a fee for something that has been proven to be ineffective. This line must be drawn. After all, no one would argue that vets should be permitted to offer crystal healing or psychic healing."

Chief Medical Officer Dame Sally Davies has also said that homeopathy is 'rubbish.'

In response, a spokesperson for the British Association of Homeopathic Veterinary Surgeons said:

> "You only have to look on our website and you will see examples of where dogs have been cured of cancer through homeopathy. By and large, people who oppose it just have an axe to grind."

Prince Charles has recently admitted to using homeopathy for treating his cattle.
