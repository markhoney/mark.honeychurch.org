A [recent article](http://www.predictweather.co.nz/ArticleShow.aspx?ID=580) on Ken Ring's Predict Weather website, presumably written by Ken, has told people not to trust anything they read in the media. In a particularly conspiratorial tone, the article says that you should not trust politicians and you should consider not taking a cancer treatment that the medical profession recommends to you.

As an extension, Ken says that his logic means that UK's Brexit will be a positive move. He's hopeful that it will also mean that climate denying politicians will come to the fore, and that Britain will become a better, richer nation when it starts to ignore climate treaties.
