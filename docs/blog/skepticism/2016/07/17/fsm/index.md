A couple of weeks ago Rachel Hoover from Illinois was allowed to use a photo with her wearing a colander for her driver's license, as it is the usual headgear for pastafarians. This week she has been asked by the Secretary of State, John Kerry, to submit a new driver's license photo [without the colander](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2016/07/10/illinois-pastafarian-told-to-get-a-new-drivers-license-without-a-colander-on-her-head/).

The issue appears to be that Rachel didn't wear the colander when she entered the facility to renew her license.
