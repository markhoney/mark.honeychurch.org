Pokemon Go is a new game where people have to use their phones and walk around their neighbourhood catching Pokemon (little animals) and visiting pokestops. Many churches are pokestops, as places of worship have been registered.

Rick Wiles, US Pastor and "orthodox Christian", has [said on his radio show](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pokemon-go-cyber-demons-rick-wiles_us_5787ff01e4b03fc3ee501a76?section) "Trunews" about Pokemon that:

> "The enemy, Satan, is targeting churches with virtual, digital, cyber-demons, I believe this thing is a magnet for demonic powers."

> "They're spawning demons inside your church. They're targeting your church with demonic activity. This technology will be used by the enemies of the cross to target, locate, and execute Christians."

> "What if this technology is transferred to Islamic jihadists, and the Islamic jihadists have an app that shows them where Christians are located geographically."

Obviously this view shows a total misunderstanding of the technology. Also, it's disappointing whenever a church is labelling new technology as evil. Parts of the church seem to be obsessed with telling their congregations that any new technology is evil.

Wiles has asked people to stop playing Pokemon Go.
