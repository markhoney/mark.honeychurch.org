I totally agree that people should not be allowed to talk about treating health conditions if they have not received approval, and hopefully the upcoming Natural Health Products bill will be a step in the right direction in New Zealand for ensuring claims can't be made without good evidence.

There is an interesting part at the end of the video where they talk about how it's not only religious fundamentalists that have killed children, and then goes on to say that the Stephans weren't worried about offending a god when their child died. However, it's interesting that the Stephans are Mormons, and the father is the creator of a multivitamin product for which many claims are made of being able to treat mental health conditions.
