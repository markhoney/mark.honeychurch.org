Chris Johnson created a coffee table book a few years ago, quoting atheists talking about their life without god. The book was titled A Better Life, and the strap line explains exactly what the book is about - "100 Atheists Speak Out on Joy & Meaning in a World Without God".

Religious believers often profess a lack of understanding of how atheists can have meaning in their life without a god - one Catholic in particular who likes to email local prominent atheists has told me that he considers the logical conclusion of my world view is to commit suicide, purely because of my lack of belief. Of course, a lack of a god given purpose does not mean a lack of any kind of purpose - I am able to find my own purpose in life, and many Kiwis who are also atheist have no problem finding purpose and living meaningful lives.

Chris has now made the book into a documentary, featuring many famous and influential atheists, and he will be in New Zealand at the end of this month to screen the film in Auckland, Wellington and Hawkes Bay. He will be giving a personal introduction to his work, and will be answering questions afterwards.

The screenings will either be free or by gold donation. More details can be found at [http://abetterlife.nz/](http://abetterlife.nz/)
