Mark Hanna at the Society for Science Based Healthcare has complained recently about the Napier Courier's column written by a local homeopathy business, called "Homeopathy Hub". the weekly column made many daft claims about the effectiveness of homeopathy, such as:

<!-- more -->

> "Homeopathic medicines are natural, toxin-free, safe and very effective medicines which will help you rebalance, relax and find your inner strength and focus. With that comes a better quality of life, enjoyment and happiness."

> "Travelling with homeopathic medicines gives you many options for dealing with physical or emotional emergencies. Depending on the country you are travelling to, this may include help for injuries, heatstroke, diarrhoea from contaminated food, adverse exposure to different climates, and so on."

> "If I had clotting problems, I would take a homeopathic medicine that reduces this risk"

> "Homeopathic medicines assist with a range of common ailments experienced, such as pain, discomfort, inflammation and bleeding."

> "homeopathic medicines can help with every facet of dental work"

The Editor has said that they are now dropping the column, which is great news.
