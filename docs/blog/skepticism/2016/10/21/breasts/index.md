He puts his hand down a woman's top, feels her breast, and presumably uses the information he gleans to work out what is in store for the woman. Of course, by using cold reading a fortune teller

Traditionally the palm is used to "read" people's future. Speaking of which, TreatMe currently has a [course in palmistry](http://local.treatme.co.nz/study-palmistry-tarot-reading-or-psychic-development-online-for-just-19-including-a-certificate-upon-completion) for $19. I'm very tempted to take their Reiki course - Reiki isn't able to treat anything, but I think it'd be fun to be a certified practitioner!
