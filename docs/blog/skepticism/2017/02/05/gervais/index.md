This is [an argument](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2017/02/02/ricky-gervais-to-stephen-colbert-you-dont-believe-in-2999-gods-i-dont-believe-in-just-1-more/) I've never heard before against an idea I occasionally hear - that belief in science is just like religion, because it requires faith. In fact, I last heard this argument only a couple of weeks ago.

> Science is constantly proved all the time. You see, if we take something like any fiction, any holy bookâ€¦ and destroyed it, in a thousand years' time, that wouldn't come back just as it was. Whereas if we took every science book, and every fact, and destroyed them all, in a thousand years they'd all be back, because all the same tests would [produce] the same result.

What a great way to explain the difference!
