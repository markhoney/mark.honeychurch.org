Anti-vaccination advocates in New Zealand have raised enough money to bring a [screening of Vaxxed](https://www.eventbrite.co.nz/e/vaxxed-from-cover-up-to-catastrophe-auckland-premiere-tickets-31979487508), a movie created by disgraced ex-doctor Andrew Wakefield and promoted by Robert de Niro, to New Zealand. The movie is an attempt to sow doubt about vaccines, and makes extensive use of secret audio recordings of CDC employee and "whistleblower" William Thompson.

The screening is interesting because the venue has been kept secret, and will only be disclosed to ticket holders hours before the event. I can see two advantages to this, from the perspective of the organisers.

1. There's a low chance that anyone will be protesting at the event
2. Nobody can attempt to pressure the venue to cancel the booking
