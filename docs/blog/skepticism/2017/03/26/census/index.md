The NZ Census asks a question of respondents about Religious Affiliation. Historically, the only response available for non-believers has been "No Religion". NZ Stats have [now added several categories](http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/90845887/census-2018-will-better-reflect-a-diverse-new-zealand-thanks-to-stats-nz-update) in time for the next Census in 2018.

<!-- more -->

The [No Religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreligion_in_New_Zealand) group has been growing steadily, and in [the last census](http://www.stats.govt.nz/Census/2013-census/profile-and-summary-reports/quickstats-culture-identity/religion.aspx) was 42%. However, there are questions about what it means to people when they tick that box.

The [new categories](http://aria.stats.govt.nz/aria/#ClassificationView:uri=http://stats.govt.nz/cms/ClassificationVersion/GgdHzXuvjRjRuOSy) give many more options:

Among the options available now for people with no religious belief are:

- No Religion
- Agnosticism
- Atheism
- Humanism
- Rationalism
- Jedi
- Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster

I would be happy ticking several of those boxes, including No Religion, Atheism, Humanism and Rationalism. I'd also be tempted to tick the FSM box!
