[Vaxxed](http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/91093182/If-you-watch-Vaxxed-know-you-re-buying-into-the-manipulation-of-a-disgraced-fraud) played at the LynnMall Reading cinema in Auckland today at 3pm. It's disappointing to see a major corporation allow a misleading, dangerous movie like Vaxxed to [play at their venue](https://www.newsroom.co.nz/2017/03/26/16819/vaxxed-in-nz) - and presumably they will be turning a profit from this. Unsurprisingly there's nothing on Reading's website or Facebook page about the screening.

Vaxxed will also be playing at the [Raglan Old School Arts Centre](https://raglanartscentre.co.nz/my-calendar/?mc_id=2800) next week, and other locations that have been kept secret:

- East Auckland (Premiere)
- West Auckland
- Whangarei
- Rotorua
- Dunedin
- Raglan
- Tauranga
- Christchurch

In the UK recently Vaxxed was shown at Regent's university, and due to secrecy around the showing university staff didn't know that the movie being shown was Vaxxed until after the event. I wonder if Reading Cinemas were aware in advance of what was being screened.

Newshub covered the event, and in response Facebook members of the Vaxxed Aus/NZ group said:

- "Newshub is a bunch of millionaires who are in secret societies"
- "Nikki Turner must be paid well to lie and lie for years"
- "What planet is that stupid women on?"
