Otago University have [defended their decision](https://www.odt.co.nz/news/campus/university-of-otago/anti-vaccines-film-screening-%E2%80%98free-speech%E2%80%99) to allow a screening of Vaxxed, citing free speech and a need to controversial topics to be discussed.

<!-- more -->

> "The screening here is able to go ahead simply to uphold the principle of free speech"

> "Our decision was made on the basis of our own values"

However, Grant Jacobs has made a very good point in a [recent blog post](http://sciblogs.co.nz/code-for-life/2017/04/07/vaxxed-university-otago-venues-able-decline/) that the secrecy surrounding the film's release, and a lack of any kind of discussion around the movie at the screenings, is antithetical to any idea of free speech. If the University really valued this screening as a way to discuss the documentary's merits, the organisers could have sorted out a Q&A session alongside the movie with health experts to discuss and critique the points that are made.
