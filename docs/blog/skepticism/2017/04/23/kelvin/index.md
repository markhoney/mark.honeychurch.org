Kelvin Cruickshank has [made the news](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&objectid=11839061) because he's promoting a new book - "Surrounded by Spirit". In the book he claims he talked with the spirit of Jonah Lomu at a show last year, apparently unaware that Jonah's brother John was in the audience:

<!-- more -->

> "I had no idea his brother was in the hall"

However, the Herald article contains several suggestions that Kelvin had more to go on. For starters, Kelvin says "I knew Jonah ­personally, he was quite close to my son". Also, it appears that Kelvin was able to see John, and presumably knew what he looks like.

> "They were sitting at the back of the theatre and I could barely see them"

Barely being able to see someone is a different thing to being unable to see someone.

So what we have here is a psychic who knew Jonah Lomu well, was most likely able to see and recognise his brother in the audience, and gave out a mix of information that either he knew already from his friendship with Jonah or was somewhat generic - "him he didn't get the chance to say goodbye". Those kinds of statements will probably fit most people who have lost a loved one. How many people really really feel when they've lost someone close to them that they were able to say goodbye properly? I bet not many do. In fact, Kelvin himself says in the book:

> "It's not unusual for me to say those words – people are rarely able to say their farewells to their loved ones before they pass over, and this guy was no exception."

Also, in the [one short chapter](http://penguin.co.nz/books/surrounded-by-spirit-9780143770428/extracts/1378-surrounded-spirit) in the book about Jonah Lomu, Kelvin manages to promote three other books of his - _Soul Secrets_, _Finding the Path_ and _Bridging the Gap_.
