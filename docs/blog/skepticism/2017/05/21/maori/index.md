There are several red flags in the article.

Firstly, the pathologist (from London) and forensic expert (from Edinburgh University) who performed the analysis (including facial reconstruction) from skulls have decided to remain anonymous. The given explanation is to avoid backlash, but of course this anonymity also ensures a lack of critical questioning about the methods used, assumptions made, etc.

The "research" also resulted in a book, rather than any academic papers - another red flag. We often see creationists, for example, skipping academia and peer review to get their ideas directly in the hands of the public by publishing sensationalist books.
