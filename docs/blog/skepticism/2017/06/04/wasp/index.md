A new alternative therapy has [become popular recently](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/ground-wasp-nest-vagina-tighten-warn-gynaecologist-painful-sex-bacteria-hiv-a7766376.html) - grinding up oak galls and putting the paste in your vagina. Oak galls are woody balls created when a wasp larva grows inside an oak tree's leaf bud. It is being claimed by sellers of this remedy that it can tighten and clean your vagina and improve your sex life.

> "In ancient times, extract of this fruit has been used for centuries to clean the vagina after childbirth, tighten the vagina, eliminate vaginal odor and discharges. Most of application is in a douching solution. In fact, this herb also suggested to prevent cervix cancer."

It goes without saying that this is a dangerous thing to do, with a definite increase in the risk of infection.

There are several silly vagina based remedies out there that people are willing to try out - herbal steaming is another that has no proven benefit, and risks of causing medical issues.

A quick search on google found ozone therapy (using a thin tube to insert ozone gas - three oxygen atoms in a molecule - into the vagina), wild yam suppositories, inserting garlic cloves, douching with vinegar and spraying colloidal silver. None of these have been proven to be effective in treating vaginal medical conditions, and as always I would recommend consulting your GP before trying out anything "alternative"
