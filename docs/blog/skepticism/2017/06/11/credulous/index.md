Radio NZ [published an article](http://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/teahikaa/audio/201846807/maori-healers-share-their-work) this week that seemed to accept, without evidence, claims that traditional Maori medicine can help with medical conditions including cancer.

The article focuses on a health expo in Whakatane, and there is talk in the article of "a space of healing", "therapists", "toxins" and "coming through".

The article interviews Bonnie Pearson, and talks about how she "was diagnosed with cancer, but recent blood tests have revealed she is now in remission." and how "She also has bone spurs that affect the spine.

> Bonnie Pearson was one of the people who I interviewed and she regarded the expo as another step in her journey to explore alternative forms of pain relief.

The Press Council says about balanced reporting:

> "Publications should be bound at all times by accuracy, fairness and balance, and should not deliberately mislead or misinform readers by commission or omission. In articles of controversy or disagreement, a fair voice must be given to the opposition view. "

Of course there is a risk when criticising traditions that you can be accused of being racist. Thankfully, although I have several successful complaints against companies in NZ selling traditional Maori therapeutic products and services, I've never been accused of being racist - and that's certainly not the impetus for my complaints. However, a colleague of mine, Daniel Ryan, was accused of this when he complained that a Kawakawa cream made unsupported therapeutic claims. Part of the response from the advertiser said:

> "I find this complaint to be a classic example of the simply racist attitudes that hold one culture's beliefs and practices to be superior to another's"
