Since a letter of mine was published in the New Zealand Medical Journal recently, I've started receiving occasional emails inviting me to send in a paper to a new journal for publication. It's immediately obvious that these are sham journals, as they call me Dr Honeychurch and are for topics that are unrelated to my area of interest (and not even expertise!), alternative medicine:

An Australian Professor has [done a good job](https://thewest.com.au/news/health/is-this-the-worlds-smartest-canine-or-has-science-gone-to-the-dogs-ng-b88479075z) of exposing just how bad these journals are by registering his dog as an editor for seven of them. They include journals on topics such as drug abuse, psychiatry and respiratory medicine.

The dog is named as "Dr Olivia Doll", and its owner - Professor Mike Daube - has been responding to the emails he's been receiving from journals owned by unscrupulous companies who try to make money from scientists by charging them to have their work published in their journals.

Dr Doll is on the editorial board of 7 journals, including being an associate editor of the "Global Journal of Addiction and Rehabilitation Medicine". The image used, rather than being that of Ollie the dog, is a picture of pop star Kylie Minogue wearing glasses.

Dr Doll's listed research interests included "the benefits of abdominal massage for medium-sized canines" and "the role of domestic canines in promoting optimal mental health in ageing males" - basically belly rubbing and making dog owners happy.
