Alex Jones, anchor man of the news outlet InfoWars in the US, hosted Robert David Steele on his show this week, and talked about Robert's theory that NASA are [holding slave children on Mars](http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2017/06/30/alex_jones_trump_endorsed_infowars_site_exposes_nasa_s_martian_slave_colony.html). This has led to NASA officially denying the accusation, along with another recent claim that there are no active rovers on Mars.

What's more worrying, however, is that InfoWars is no longer being treated in the US as an unreliable, fringe news source - at least by the Trump administration. Recently Jerome Corsi from InfoWars was given a White House day press pass. Jerome was a prominent "birther" during Obama's presidency, pushing the idea that he was born in Kenya and therefore ineligible to be president.

President Trump told Alex Jones last year that "your reputation is amazing" and "I will not let you down" on Jones' show.
