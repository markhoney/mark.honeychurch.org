I'm hoping that the anti-GMO crowd don't sink the [new GMO banana](http://www.newsweek.com/scientists-orange-bananas-vitamin-uganda-633136) before it has a chance to be properly tested. The banana has had genes inserted that allow it to create alpha and beta carotenes, which allow our bodies to create vitamin A, which should help some of the quarter of a million children who die every year due to a lack of the vitamin.

Unfortunately, I'm not too optimistic. Golden Rice, which has also been engineered to contain lots of vitamin A, will probably never see the light of day due to lobbying from groups like Greenpeace.
