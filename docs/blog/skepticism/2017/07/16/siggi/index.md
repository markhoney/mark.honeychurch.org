The Spinoff [did a great job](https://thespinoff.co.nz/science/13-07-2017/is-siggi-henry-new-zealands-most-dangerous-city-councillor/) of looking into Hamilton Councillor Siggi Henry's views on a variety of topics. It turns out that she's anti fluoride, anti-fat (she recently said that obesity was a risk to others as fat people could fall on you and hurt you) and anti-vaccine.

The depths of her anti-vaccine views are pretty astonishing. It turns out she believes there is no such thing as the measles virus, and probably no polio either.
