There's a lack of rural doctors in NZ, and one doctor has [spoken on Radio NZ](http://www.radionz.co.nz/audio/player?audio_id=201852204) this week about the [trials and tribulations](http://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/checkpoint/audio/201852204/doctor-fears-immigration-red-tape-may-force-him-out-of-nz) he's suffered trying to renew his visa to stay in the country. Dr Feller is a GP at Mountainview Medical Centre in Hawera, and the medical centre is badly in need of the service he provides. Losing him would not be good for the local community.

The sting in the tail of this story, however, is that we've talked about "Dr Mitch" before. He's the doctor who is a 50% owner of PureCure, the company that has been [selling bleach](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/94753064/medsafe-criticised-for-slow-response-to-claimed-cancerkiller-te-kiri-gold) made on Vernon Coxhead's farm as a cure for cancer. In fact, Dr Feller's testimonial was added to the label on bottles of this bleach:

> "I've repeatedly seen it work in my surgery. Patients can't believe it and immediately want more. See what you think. That's my guarantee!"

I met with Medsafe a few weeks ago to talk about some of the complaints I've sent in to them over the last couple of years, and their apparent inaction. They seem to have taken some positive steps with regards to PureCure, but in my opinion it was too little too late.
