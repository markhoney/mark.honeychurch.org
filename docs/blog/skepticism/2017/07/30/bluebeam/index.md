Last week I learned about a new conspiracy theory from Weather Wars International, a Facebook group dedicated to spreading nonsense about government control of the weather. A video [posted to the group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1310150419018802/permalink/1666810930019414/) shows a field and trees, along with a light halo and what appears to be a rotating planet in the background.

The video is 27s long, and shows nearly a full rotation of the "planet". I'm no geophysicist, but I would suspect that a planet that close to us, and rotating that fast, would spell an end to planet earth.

My conclusion is that this is likely a digital effects project from a University student or similar. However, other people, including those who believe in government weather control, have jumped to a different conclusion - this is solid evidence of [project Blue Beam](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Project_Blue_Beam):

In essence, the idea is that NASA is colluding with the antichrist to fake the second coming of christ and usher in a New World Order.

The way that NASA (along with the UN) is planning to do this is by using a four step plan:

1. Cause earthquakes at strategic locations around the world, which bring to light fake archaeological discoveries that overturn our understanding of religious history.
2. Use holographic lasers to project images of god over the heads of everyone on the planet. This image will differ by region, matching the most dominant belief in each area. This image will slowly morph into the image of the antichrist. This will be accompanied by playing of Beethoven's Ode to Joy.
3. Use low frequency RF to beam the voice of god into people's heads
4. Fake an alien invasion, fake the beginnings of the rapture and send supernatural forces to everyone via copper and fibre cables:

> "The waves used at that time will allow "supernatural forces" to travel through optical fibers, coaxial cables (TV) electrical and phone lines in order to penetrate to everyone at once through major appliances. Embedded chips will already be in place. The goal of this deals with global Satanic ghosts projected all around the world in order to push all populations to the edge of hysteria and madness, to drown them into a wave of suicide, murder and permanent psychological disorders. After the Night of the Thousand Stars, worldwide populations will be ready for the new messiah to re-establish order and peace at any cost, even at the cost of abdication of freedom."

Once these steps have been completed, everyone will be willing to accept the new world government.

As with the video I saw this week of the "planet" hovering in the sky, pretty much anything odd is taken as evidence of this theory, e.g. UFO sightings are tests of the holographic technology. Apparently a machine's been invented which can lift lots of people into the air at once, and will help with faking the rapture.

I'm scratching my head as to how a crackpot theory from the 90s seems to have gained so much traction on the internet. The theory was invented by Serge Monast, who then died a couple of years later from a heart attack - and, of course, now that fact is part of the conspiracy theory.

I guess the creation of places online where people can talk with others who think the same makes these ideas seem less crazy, and ultimately easier to swallow.
