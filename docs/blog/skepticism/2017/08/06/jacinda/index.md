Vinny Eastwood [has suggested](https://www.facebook.com/VinnyEastwoodShow/photos/a.548975021804450.1073741825.205204582848164/1354741621227782/?type=3&theater) that the new head of the Labour Party is in league with the Freemasons:

Vinny's idea seems to be that because she's, possibly, received a scholarship from the Freemasons, she must be connected to them in some shadowy way. Of course, this goes hand in hand with the idea that the Freemasons are a secretive underground political group planning to overthrow the world's governments, or quietly running the world.
