The Herald [published an article](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/technology/news/article.cfm?c_id=5&objectid=11913705) about someone's prediction that the world will end in a few weeks. David Meade, described as a Christian numerologist, claims that on or just after September the 20th (my birthday!), the world will meet a fiery end.

<!-- more -->

His predictions were made based on passages in the bible, such as Isaiah, Chapter 13, 9-10:

> "See, the Day of the Lord is coming - a cruel day, with wrath and fierce anger - to make the land desolate and destroy the sinners within it. The stars of heaven and their constellations will not show their light. The rising sun will be darkened and the moon will not give its light."

However, he confirmed his predictions through looking at the measurements and markings of the Egyptian pyramids. Apparently the East-West line that crosses the most land, and the North-South line crosses the most land intersect at two points, and one of them is the Great Pyramid at Giza. On September 20th, the two tunnels into the pyramid will point to Jupiter and a star called Regulusâ€¦ and somehow this means that we're all going to die.

So, from the middle of September, remember to look up at night and see if you can spot Nibiru hurtling towards us.

I wonder how many times Meade will end up making failed predictions before he stops trying - Harold Camping kept predicting the end of the earth every few years until his death.
