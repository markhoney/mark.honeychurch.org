David Meade, who I spoke about last month as predicting the end of the world around the 20th of September, has [given us all a reprieve](http://metro.co.uk/2017/09/25/death-planet-nibiru-is-actually-going-to-hit-earth-on-october-21-christians-now-claim-6953324/#). Obviously the world didn't end, but he now says that October the 21st is the real end of the world.

Apparently on October 5, Planet X will fully eclipse the sun and cover the earth in shadow.

We can expect a biblical 7 years of tribulation starting on the 21st, but I'm pretty sure that come October the 22nd David will make the news once again as he explains that we're experiencing a "metaphorical" end of the world.
