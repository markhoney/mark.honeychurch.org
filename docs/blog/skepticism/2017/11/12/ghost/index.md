After a [ghost was spotted](https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/98635179/ghost-in-trade-me-auction-photo-debunked) in a picture of a mirror being sold in a [TradeMe auction](https://www.trademe.co.nz/home-living/home-d%C3%A9cor/mirrors/wall-mounted/auction-1456374682.htm), Wendy McCawe from Wellington Photographic Supplies quickly spotted that the "ghost" in question was actually a picture of the lead character from TV show Outlander. I'm impressed that she spotted it - I put the image through online forensic image tool Forensically, and couldn't see anything.

When confronted with the evidence of fakery in the questions for the auction, the seller said:

> "I assume lots of people dressed in a similar fashion in the olden days"

I don't buy that for a second - the image is so clear, and so clearly taken from Outlander, that it looks unlikely to be anything but deliberate - although in this case the fraud was discovered so early that there were no credulous news stories to have to contend with.
