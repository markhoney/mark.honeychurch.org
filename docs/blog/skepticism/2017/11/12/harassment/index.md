Republican Senate candidate Judge Roy Moore has been [accused of sexually assaulting](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&objectid=11942862) a 14 girl when he was 14. He has a worrying track record - as well as other accusations of sexual harassment of young girls, he's twice been promoted to the Supreme Court and then removed because of his refusal to follow church/state separation laws. He was suspended for trying to stop legal gay marriages from being performed.

Now he's had a staff member jump to his defence by using Joseph and Mary as a parallel:

> "Take Joseph and Mary. Mary was a teenager and Joseph was an adult carpenter. They became parents of Jesus. There's just nothing immoral or illegal here. Maybe just a little bit unusual."
