Sir Peter Gluckman, the PM's Science Advisor, says that NZ has a [science denial problem](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11952249), but that it's no worse than the rest of the world. Peter thinks that social media bubbles are contributing to this issue, by allowing people to get their news only from places that agree with their existing views on topics. He points out that traditional media is becoming more likely to be polarised as well, which is not good.
