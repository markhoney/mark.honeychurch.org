18 classes of health product [are being de-funded](https://www.pharmacy.biz/nhs-england-scraps-18-low-value-treatments-prescription-following-consultation/) by the NHS in the UK, including 7 that are blacklisted:

<!-- more -->

- Homeopathy
- Herbal treatments
- Omega-3 fatty acid compounds (fish oil)
- Co-proxamol
- Rubefacients (excluding topical NSAIDS)
- Lutein and antioxidants
- Glucosamine and chondroitin

This is great news for consumers in the UK. Any state support of alternative health products helps to legitimise them, and that's dangerous.
