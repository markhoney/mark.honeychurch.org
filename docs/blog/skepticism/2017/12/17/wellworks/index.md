A new pharmacy called Wellworks, focussing on natural health products, is [due to open](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/99891673/medicine-deliveries-apps-and-kombucha-tonics-welcome-to-the-millennial-pharmacy) in Wellington in January.

The store is hoping to offer kombucha to drink at a "wellness" bar, along with many other alternative products. However, they've drawn the line at homeopathy - which is more than can be said for a lot of pharmacies!

The owners say:

> "We're trying to just stock things that have scientific evidence," Horwood said. "In a pharmacy people have that trust thing, and you don't want to ruin that."

Somehow, I'm skeptical about this - a pharmacy that only stocks evidence based treatments would not be selling kombucha or any other alternative product - these products are only alternative because they do not have robust evidence to back up their claims of efficacy.
