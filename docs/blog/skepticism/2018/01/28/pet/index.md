As if people not vaccinating their kids isn't enough nonsense to deal with, there's an [increasing trend](http://www.newshub.co.nz/home/world/2018/01/anti-vaccination-movement-turns-its-sights-to-pet-vaccines.html) for pet owners to [not vaccinate their pets](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&objectid=11981394) as well. This appears to be due to silly concerns such as that their pets might suffer from autism, despite the fact that autism hasn't been observed in animals.

The owner of a website against pet vaccination - [Stop the Shots](http://www.stoptheshots.com/) - says there are dangers with vaccinations, but admits that he doesn't have a scientific background.

Pets are like kids in many ways - they depend on their owners to make sensible decisions about their healthcare.
