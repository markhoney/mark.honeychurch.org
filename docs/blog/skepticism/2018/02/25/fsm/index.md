[In a setback](https://www.stuff.co.nz/life-style/101665235/student-blocked-from-wearing-colander-as-religious-headwear-in-school-photo) for the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster (FSM), a school kid has been told that his rights at his school don't cover being able to wear a colander on his head for a school picture.

The teen, from Pakuranga College, wanted to wear the colander as he claimed it was his right, as it's religious headgear. This follows from the religion receiving recognition in NZ through people having driving licenses wearing a colander, wearing a colander during a citizenship ceremony, someone registering as an FSM marriage celebrant and a pastafarian wedding.

The boy seems to have dropped his attempt to argue that he should be allowed to wear his colander, although it seems likely that if he'd fought and taken his case to the Human Rights Commissioner, he would have been allowed.
