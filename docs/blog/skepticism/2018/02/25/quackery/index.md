Liza Schneider has [written an article](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/animals-pets/news/article.cfm?c_id=500834&objectid=11999154) for the BoP Times, printed online in the Herald, which promotes nonsense therapies for animals.

I've complained about Liza in the past, to the ASA, the NZVA and the NZVC.

Unfortunately the NZVA have recently weakened their stance on alternative therapies, which is a bad thing for animal welfare.They won the Skeptics' Bent Spoon award late last year for their new stance.

Mark Hanna has already made a complaint to the Editor, and he will be complaining to the Press Council if his concerns are not addressed.
