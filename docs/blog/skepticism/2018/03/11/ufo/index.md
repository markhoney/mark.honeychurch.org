In an [article on the NZ Herald](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/opinion/news/article.cfm?c_id=466&objectid=12010486), reprinted from the Washington Post, Christopher Mellon argues that there is solid evidence for UFOs, and that the US are not doing enough to investigate.

Christopher works for the [To The Stars Academy](http://www.tothestarsacademy.com/) of Arts and Science, which is a new organisation set up by a member of the band Blink 182 and some supposedly ex high ranking members of government and aerospace companies like Lockheed Martin.

The new term for UFOs, UAPs (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena) seems to be popular on the Academy's website, but the most striking thing is that they are raising money for their research and making movies. So far they've sold over $2.5 million in $5 shares, to around 3,000 people - that's nearly $1,000 invested per person, on average. This is worrying, given that the prospectus says:

> "We have not generated any revenue from the aerospace and science projects we plan to pursue, nor do we have deals in place yet to do so. Our valuation has not been validated by any independent third party, and may decrease precipitously in the future."
