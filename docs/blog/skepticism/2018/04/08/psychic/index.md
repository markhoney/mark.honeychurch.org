A fraudster has [conned a clairvoyant](https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/fp/news/local/caught-dead-handed-north-east-clairvoyant-shocked-after-fraudster-impersonated-her-and-tried-to-con-people-out-of-cash1/), Maureen Smith, in the UK by pretending to be her on Facebook and charging people money for online readings. The scammer sent messages to all of Maureen's friends through an account that was a copy of the real Maureen's account. Things were going well for the scammer until they sent an invite to Maureen's husband.

Maureen visited the police, but has not filed a complaint. Presumably the police have enough sense to realise that the real Maureen Smith is also a fraudster and as such her fraudulent "career" is probably not deserving of the protection of the law.
