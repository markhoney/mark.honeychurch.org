Brittany Kara, from the US, is apparently a Christian author, NLP practitioner, hypnotherapist and nutrition coach. She's also an anti-vaxxer, and records herself speaking for a YouTube channel where she talks about her views.

In a recent video, Kara talked about the bible and vaccines. It seems that rather than reading the bible, her immediate idea was to [google for an answer](http://deadstate.org/anti-vaxxer-warrior-mom-if-vaccines-are-so-great-why-arent-they-mentioned-in-the-bible/).

It turns out that, because the bible doesn't mention vaccines, they're bad. If they weren't bad, god would have mentioned them. Of course, there's a massive irony here. Kara has used a mobile phone to record herself, and used the internet to post the video to a server thousands of miles away.
