There's a new fad to put [mushroom in your coffee](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/food-and-drink/features/farewell-turmeric-latte-mushroom-latest-coffee-trend/). Claims are being made that these powdered mushrooms can help your health and wellbeing.

<!-- more -->

> "purportedly an anti-inflammatory, and is supposed to regulate blood sugar levels and boost metabolism"

> "Cordyceps mushrooms are adaptogenic in their anti-aging, brain health, and detox properties. They are also great for the libidoâ€¦"

Of course, not only is there no good evidence that these herbal remedies are good for you, but in this case it's apparent that the mushroom taste doesn't go well with coffee. People are having to use sugar and flavourings such as cinnamon to mask the mushroom taste.

As this is a UK news story, I hoped that just maybe this kind of nonsense isn't for sale in NZ - and, of course, I was wrong. Websites are selling it, such as:

- [Purely Natural](https://www.purelynaturalnz.co.nz/products/four-sigmatic-mushroom-coffee-with-lions-mane-productivity?variant=51112972115)
- BioHacker
- iHerb
- Alchemy Nutrition

> Four Sigmatic Mushroom Coffee Mix with Cordyceps and Chaga.

> "Thanks to our favourite medicinal mushrooms, now you can use coffee to crank up your productivity and boost your metabolism without putting strain on your body."

This fad follows on from another recent fad for putting turmeric in coffee - another waste of time and money that some people seem to be quick to jump at. I wonder what's going to be next?
