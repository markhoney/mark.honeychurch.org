I've found another fun conspiracy theory - [V2K](https://targetedindividualscanada.com/2010/06/24/article-what-is-voice-to-skull/). Weirdly, it stands for "Voice to Skull" and is a technology where voices can be beamed directly to your head. This is another conspiracy theory that until recently was new to me. The idea is [based on the fact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave_auditory_effect) that microwaves can be used to create a clicking noise inside someone's head. This is known as the microwave auditory effect, and was discovered in World War Two by people who worked near radar devices. The likely mechanism for the clicking is that parts of the inner ear are being rapidly heated up by the radio waves. The microwaves can be varied to create what sounds like a human voice inside someone's head, which is pretty cool.

Now, of course, it's not advisable to microwave someone's head, and I'm pretty sure this isn't being done by any shadowy government agency. Apparently this technique causes high-intensity shockwaves, which are likely to cause brain damage. But for some people, there is a firm belief that this technology has been perfected and is being used to harass the public. Apparently there is no way of blocking these signals.

Given that electromagnetic waves can be effectively blocked, I get the feeling that for the people suffering from this kind of torment the voice is coming from inside their brain. It seems more likely that these unfortunate people have some kind of mental health condition, such as schizophrenia. In fact, I found a website called Targeted Individuals which says:

> "Most of the symptoms of schizophrenia are similar to the symptoms of people who are being targeted by organized stalking and electronic harassments"

It's saddening to think that rather than receiving good medical advice, some people with these conditions will end up in a place where they are convinced they are being persecuted.
