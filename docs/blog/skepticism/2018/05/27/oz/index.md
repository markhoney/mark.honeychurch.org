President Trump will be promoting Dr Mehmet Oz to the President's Council on Sports, Fitness & Nutrition, which is a little worrying. Trump's no stranger to making what look like very bad staffing decisions, and this one is no exception. Dr Oz is well known in the US, having risen from the Oprah show to having his own show. On his show, the Dr Oz Show, he's promoted [so many nonsense treatments](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-nominating-dr-oz-presidential-council-sport-fitness-nutrition/) that he's been told off by the FTC and summoned to talk in front of a senate sub-committee.

The problem is so bad that research by Health News Reviews found that almost 80% of statements on the show did not align with evidence based guidelines. These included telling people not to eat apples and to remove their amalgam fillings, and promoting reparative therapy, a totally discredited therapy for "curing" gayness.

It also turns out that most products being talked about in the show were related to adverts shown during the program's breaks.
