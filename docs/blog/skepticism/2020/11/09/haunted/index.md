Last week Craig promised that we would give you a link to a video Haunted NZ were producing about their recent investigation at a house in Pukekohe. We have now been sent a copy of the video, and you can watch it on the [NZ Skeptics YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/HMXMtDn5txw). Craig also [gave a good account](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/pukekohe-paranormal-watch-ghost-busters-investigate-haunted-house/KYJNKLRZXZUWUTDATLKMC6XB3Q/) to the NZ Herald of why the video, although slickly put together, contains no substantive evidence backing up Haunted NZâ€™s claims that the house was ever haunted.

Good work Craig!
