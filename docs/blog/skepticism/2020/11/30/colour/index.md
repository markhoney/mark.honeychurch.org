For some of us who have attended the regular [Skeptical Activism meetings](https://www.meetup.com/Wellington-Skeptics-in-the-Pub) in Wellington, [Colour Therapy Manukau](http://www.colourtherapymanukau.co.nz/)'s egregious claims about colour therapy such as “incurable means curable from within” and “synthetic fibres have a frequency that is detrimental to our health and well being” are a familiar sight. Several of us have cut our teeth on their website, making Advertising Standards Authority complaints about lists of diseases that colour can therapy can supposedly cure, and pseudo-scientific claims about how coloured wool in a metal bowl can help you. These days, when you browse their website, instead of seeing those kinds of claims you read the following:

> “To know about the types of conditions we may be able to assist with, please contact us direct.”

> “if you wish to obtain further details, please check out our contact page on how to get in touch with us.”

> “Should you wish to see the numerous testimonials that we receive regularly here at the clinic, please feel free to contact us and at your request we will either mail or email them to you.”

It’s a small win, but it’s great to see that we’ve been able to make something of a difference in this case - and in the case of several hundred other companies who have had to remove dangerous medical claims that we’ve complained about over the last 8 years.
