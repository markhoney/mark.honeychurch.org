In the news this morning, it’s been reported that our very own [New Zealand monolith](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/123769650/aliens-or-artists-mysterious-metal-monolith-pops-up-in-christchurch-the-latest-home-to-the-global-phenomenon) has appeared at Adventure Park in Christchurch. I’d love to think that this monolith could stay until I get a chance to visit it, but given that the original monolith mysteriously disappeared, and that a bunch of young Christians destroyed a similar monolith in California and replaced it with a cross, I worry that our version may not last long.

I have to assume that this proliferation of monoliths, rather than being a carefully planned stunt, is more likely to be the work of copy cats who want to add to the mystery. My understanding is that the monoliths are rather simply constructed, and that the hard problems are getting them to their destination and digging a hole to place them in.
