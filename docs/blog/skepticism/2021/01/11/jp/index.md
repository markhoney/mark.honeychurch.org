I’m sure many skeptics have enjoyed JP Sears’ [parody videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/AwakenWithJP) of the wellness industry, such as [How to Become Gluten Intolerant](https://youtu.be/Oht9AEq1798) and [How to be Ultra Spiritual](https://youtu.be/1kDso5ElFRg). It was a surprise to me, just before Christmas, to read that despite poking fun, JP Sears has for a long time been a seller of nonsense. [An article](https://www.mcgill.ca/oss/article/covid-19-critical-thinking-pseudoscience/clown-prince-wellness) from the Office for Science and Society at McGill University in Canada details JP Sears’ history of selling unregulated therapy sessions and useless supplements, and sadly also his recent descent into COVID-19 science denial.

The article talks about “conspirituality” - a mixture of conspiracy and spirituality. We’ve seen this recently in NZ, with some of the weirder summer festivals embracing conspiracy thinking, hosting conspiracy lectures and workshops, etc. At least it’s been good to see that some in the local spiritual community are concerned enough about this shift that they’re actively trying to combat it, both in the media and at the festival events.
