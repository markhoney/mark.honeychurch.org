Last weekend **Billy TK** organised a **protest against lockdown** in **Auckland**, and followed it up with a second rally in **Wellington **on Thursday. As soon as I heard about the Wellington rally, during my lunch break in the office, I dropped my sandwich and headed to **parliament **to mingle with those who have a very different worldview to mine. Police presence was near non-existent when I arrived, although the media were there in force - ready to report in case Billy ordered his minions to storm the Beehive.

Now, some people might be wondering how you can have a protest against lockdown in a country that hasn’t had a lockdown for many months now. Well, Billy TK has been letting people know that **military insiders** have been briefing him that the government was planning a new lockdown starting on the **15th of January** (last Friday). Of course, this hasn’t happened, and Billy and others are already **taking the credit** for this - saying that lockdown was averted because they blew the whistle and foiled the plot! It’s like [Lisa Simpson’s rock](https://youtu.be/xSVqLHghLpw) she sells to Homer that keeps tigers away.

What a great way to wriggle out of a totally ridiculous prediction not coming true. I’m sure most of Billy’s followers will see this explanation as **more evidence** that Jacinda is a communist who is trying to take our freedoms, and that Billy’s Public Party are the only ones who can **save us** from spiralling into becoming a repressive regime where we are all imprisoned - rather than seeing through his farce and coming to their senses.

### Mary Byrne

Mary Byrne spoke briefly - she’s the head of **Fluoride Free NZ**, and her mission to rid New Zealand’s water of fluoride will have a **negative effect** on people’s dental health if she’s ever successful.

### Antoinette James

Antoinette James spoke as well - she’s a New Zealand author of a range of horrible books, including "**Call Us a Biblical Christian Family**", about the importance of home schooling for Christians, and "**We Are Revolting**", about secretive groups who control the world and want to destroy Christianity:

> "Ever wondered why there is no real desire from the ruling class to hold onto the ancient cultural landmarks? Why over 70 genders exist? Why populations are highly polarised as communities? And why the elite performed a multi-cultural social experiment across the West in the mid-1900s? A New World Order is coming. The world's nations even now are in freefall. When the oligarchy is organised enough, have control enough, they will speed-up their agenda."

> "**White genocide is not a new phenomenon. Hundreds of millions of white predominantly Christian individuals were sent to their deaths in pre-arranged wars and revolutions in the 20th Century**. That is more than the total count of all of history. In just 100 years the earth's white demographics went from 30% to 10% of the world's population. The globalists agenda for the 21st Century is not war, but a disenfranchising of white nations and cultures by managed food, water and health protocols."

### Billy TK

At the Wellington rally Billy talked about a range of topics, including "purple pink-haired communist" Dr **Siouxie Wiles**, **Ashley "Doomfield"**, Agenda 21 & Agenda 2030, the **Great Reset** and schools teaching about **masturbation**:

### Rashid Buttar

After talking, Billy phoned "Dr" Rashid Buttar and let him speak to the crowd. We were then told **11 reasons** why we should **refuse **the COVID vaccine. Those reasons included some of the rules for after you have been vaccinated:

* You have to keep wearing a mask
* You still have to social distance
* You have to have a second vaccine injection weeks later

It’s as if this fake doctor thinks that a vaccine is a **magic bullet**, instant and foolproof. Rather, these rules are because the vaccine takes time to work, and is not 100% effective - and of course that’s the case for all medicine.

We were also told that in a trial of the vaccine most (63) of the 65 women involved were made **sterile **- and that this is **deliberate**. This idea is part of the Great Reset conspiracy, where most of the population will be killed or made sterile to rapidly reduce the population to **500 million**.

The Great Reset actually exists, and is a **World Economic Forum** suggestion that we should rebuild the world economy to be **more sustainable** after the pandemic has been overcome, but for conspiracy theorists this has been rolled in with the enigmatic Georgia Guidestones, messages carved on stones in Georgia:

1. Maintain humanity under 500,000,000 in perpetual balance with nature.
2. Guide reproduction wisely — improving fitness and diversity.
3. Unite humanity with a living new language.
4. Rule passion — faith — tradition — and all things with tempered reason.
5. Protect people and nations with fair laws and just courts.
6. Let all nations rule internally resolving external disputes in a world court.
7. Avoid petty laws and useless officials.
8. Balance personal rights with social duties.
9. Prize truth — beauty — love — seeking harmony with the infinite.
10. Be not a cancer on the Earth — Leave room for nature — Leave room for nature.

## Auckland Rally

The Auckland and Wellington rallies included many **signs **with silly messages on them, with some of the funnier ones including:

* **C**ertificate **O**f **V**accine **ID** - an idea that COVID is an acronym, proving it was all planned
* Noah was a conspiracy theorist, then it started to rain
* Masks kill lives
* Sunshine save lives
* Socialism distancing
* Blood & organ harvesting, modern day slavery
* MSM-FB and this Muppet Show government are hiding the truth
* We are [sovereign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_citizen_movement)
* Stop stealing our freedom, Comrade Jacinda
* NZ has been subjected to socialist brainwashing
* Children are being tortured, [Pizzagate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizzagate_conspiracy_theory) should be investigated not ignored
* Close the media for 30 days and watch 80% of World Problems go away
* I will not be muzzled, tested, tracked, [chipped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ID2020#COVID-19_conspiracy_theory) or vaccinated to support this orchestrated lie
* COVID-19 is a manipulated UN/World/Media Instalment of a ‘[Global Reset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Reset)’ for Socialist/Communist Totalitarian Control By the 1% Elite. We Do Not Consent

The **march** in Auckland, down and back up Queen Street, included YouTube conspiracy video star **Vinny Eastwood** (whose channel was recently "demonetised", causing him great consternation) shouting a variety of daft **chants** that the crowd (of maybe 150) echoed:

* No 1080, no fluoridation, no chemtrails, no Agenda 21
* No more Labour, no more Greens, they’re corrupt
* No 1080, no chemtrails, no mass surveillance
* No more scumbaggery, no more corruption, shove it up your bum
* No AI, controlling our lives
* No more COVID, it’s a fricking hoax
* Disobey the lockdown, January 15
* No more Jacinda, no more Cindy, ruling our lives
* You can stick your New World Order up your ass (sung to the tune of She’ll be Coming Round the Mountain)
* No World Economic Forum, they’re bad and we need to destroy them
* No radiation, destroying our nation, while people play playstation
* No more Jacinda, she’s just a sinner, no more Jacinda, she just wants to skin ya
* No more Jizzy, Jizzy in your face

One good outcome of the recent unrest both here and in the US is that the social media accounts of many conspiracy theorists here in NZ have been **restricted, suspended or deleted**, where people have been breaching the sites’ Terms of Service by sharing dangerous misinformation. People like **Vinny Eastwood, Damien De Ment**, ACT Party candidate **Stephen Berry** and the group **Mothers Who Stand For Freedom** have all seen various social media accounts unavailable for them to spread their nonsense on.
