## 2020

When it comes to predicting what would happen in 2020, we can **forgive** the **futurists, economists** and other experts who failed to account for the wide-ranging effects of COVID-19.  However there are a class of people we **can’t forgive**, those who really should have been able to warn everyone of the impending changes - **psychics, astrologers, tarot readers, numerologists**, etc.

Of all the predictions I read made at the beginning of 2020, **none of them** came close to predicting **COVID** - although a few have tried claiming since that they could feel it was coming, but didn’t think to mention it at the time.

### Asparagus

A woman who **[uses asparagus to predict the future](https://www.iradio.ie/asparagus/)** made several predictions at the beginning of last year, including:

* Storms, typhoons, hurricanes and flooding will increase tenfold.
* Brexit’s impact won’t be as bad as people think.
* There will still be some turmoil within the Royal family. She’s also predicted more royal births but royal bereavements too.
* Trump will win a second term. However, he’ll face impeachment again and this time it will be carried through.
* A renowned showbiz personality will announce his retirement from public life

These are a mix of the **silly** (what scientific reason could there be for storms to increase tenfold?), the **wrong** (Trump) and the **obvious** (of course there was turmoil within the Royal family - there usually is, and I’m sure many showbiz personalities retired from public life last year).

### Sylvia Browne

The internet is awash with the idea that now dead psychic Sylvia Browne, a well known and much despised con artist, **predicted COVID** in a book many years ago:

> “In around 2020 a severe pneumonia-like illness will spread throughout the globe, attacking the lungs and the bronchial tubes and resisting all known treatments.”
> _End of Days: Predictions and prophecies about the end of the world, 2008._

However, the book is filled with a scattershot-like list of wide-ranging predictions, most of which have not come to pass. For example, Sylvia asserted that **blindness would be cured by 2012** (showing a gross misunderstanding of blindness, with its many different biological causes) and that **paralysis and Parkinson’s would be eradicated by 2020**.

## 2021

Unsurprisingly, many psychics are predicting continuing **turmoil** around the world in 2021 due to COVID, along with political unrest. Predictions that January 20th (Biden’s inauguration day) will be a rocky day feel like **laziness** coming from people who claim to have supernatural insight into the future.

### June Field

The “**world’s greatest psychic medium**” (the winner of a psychic TV show) has predicted, in the Guardian, that **2021** is “**a stepping stone to something better**” and that financially “**2022 feels lighter and brighter than 2021**”. It all felt a little too **nebulous** to be of any practical use.

Of course, it’s a common tactic of fortune tellers to speak in **vague platitudes** that make people feel better without ever saying anything concrete or useful.

### Nostradamus

Apparently Nostradamus has predicted **zombies** for 2021, writing:

> “**Few young people: half−dead to give a start**. Dead through spite, he will cause the others to shine, And in an exalted place some great evils to occur: Sad concepts will come to harm each one, Temporal dignified, the Mass to succeed. Fathers and mothers dead of infinite sorrows, Women in mourning, the pestilent she−monster: The Great One to be no more, all the world to end.”

Nostradamus wrote a lot of vague quatrains of text, which people have spent countless hours retrospectively fitting to historical events. Other predictions for 2021, which people have tried to make from Nostradamus’ word salad, include **muslims** taking over the world, a large **comet** hitting earth, **famine**, **solar storms**, California destroyed by an **earthquake** and soldiers with **microchips** in their brains.
