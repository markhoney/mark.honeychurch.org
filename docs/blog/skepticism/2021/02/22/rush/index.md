The controversial conservative US radio host Rush Limbaugh died this week. Although this isn’t something that the NZ Skeptics feel is okay to celebrate, we do acknowledge that Limbaugh was responsible for the spreading of many damaging and harmful conspiracy theories, and was very mean spirited to people he saw as the enemies of the US, including those who were black, gay, liberal, female and/or atheist. Unsurprisingly, the work Rush Limbaugh undertook spreading his divisive message was recently rewarded with the Medal of Freedom. Rather than going into more details of Limbaugh’s life, I will leave it to the (hopefully impartial) [BBC’s obituary](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-54646305) if you would like to know more.
