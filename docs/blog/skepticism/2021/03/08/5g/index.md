I’m guessing that **Jami-Lee Ross**, head of the failed conspiracy themed political party Advance NZ, has run out of money. Why else would he be planning to flog useless **anti-5G pills** to us?

<!-- more -->

Charlie Mitchell at Stuff found out that Ross has recently formed a new company called **Praesidium Life** along with a naturopath called **Michael Kelly**. Looking at Michael’s current business, [The Health Centre](https://healthcenter.nz/) in St Benedict’s, it’s obvious that Michael has no interest in evidence when it comes to healthcare. The website appears to be almost entirely devoid of any useful, honest medical advice, instead pushing **chiropractic**, **reflexology**, **hCG **for weight loss and **coriander **for heavy metal detox.

When I clicked on the Shop link I was greeted with even more egregious nonsense at a website called [Natural Solutions](https://naturalsolutions.nz/) - **curcumin** (turmeric), **probiotics** and **GcMAF**.

NZ Skeptics committee member Dan Ryan told Stuff:

> “The spread of health misinformation is not slowing down, and people are being harmed or even dying because of it. We need more regulation with regulatory bodies that actually have the power and the resources to stop it.”

I’m no psychic, but given what I know about the Society for Science Based Healthcare (disclaimer: I’m currently chair of the society), I see Michael’s future involving one or more emails from the Advertising Standards Authority, and a lot of work trying to defend claims such as that “the Ketogenic Diet is a low carbohydrate, high fat diet, that starves the cancer cells” and “the higher someone's cholesterol, the lower their risk of death due to cardiovascular disease”.

As for Jami and Michael’s potential future business, it is reported to involve selling Praesidium - “the natural solution to electromagnetic radiation”. **Dr Marco Ruggiero** from Italy is apparently behind the product, and his other accolades include a probiotic yogurt for treating autism and AIDS, and a magic anti-ageing pill. Names of products he’s connected with include Immortalis, Imuno and EDestiny - all fancy sounding, and all total nonsense.

Rest assured we will be keeping a close eye on how this one develops, and we will be quick to pounce on any dodgy claims we find when the new company’s website goes live.
