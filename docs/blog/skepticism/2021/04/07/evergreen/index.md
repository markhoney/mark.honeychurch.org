The Outdoors Party's health spokesperson recently [shared a video clip](https://www.facebook.com/tracy.livingston.14/posts/3617057235086350) from the TV show Dexter, showing a scene where the serial killer protagonist of the show remembers being rescued as a child from a shipping container - and, as you might have guessed, the container has EVERGREEN written down the side. Coincidence? Apparently not, if you’re one of the many people who believe that the Ever Given, which was recently freed from the Suez Canal, was transporting children as part of a child sex trade run by Hillary Clinton.

So, in a nutshell the codename the Secret Service used for Hillary when they protected her was “Evergreen”, and the Ever Given’s callsign was H3RC, which is similar to Hillary Rodham Clinton’s initials of HRC.

Never mind that [Evergreen Marine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evergreen_Marine) is the fifth largest shipping company in the world, so spurious connections with TV shows, news stories, code names and the like are bound to happen. What should we read into the fact that a truck carrying an Evergreen container recently found itself [stuck on the Shenzhen highway](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/first-ship-now-truck-carrying-evergreen-container-in-china-causes-traffic-jam-goes-viral/6U6W7MSNEPIFQTJSPAYUO4IIYM/) in China, blocking traffic? Surely it’s not coincidence if they block traffic twice? And what about the incident in 1992 where an Evergreen ship [lost a container](https://www.businessinsider.in/science/news/the-company-behind-the-suez-canal-blockage-once-spilled-28800-plastic-toys-into-the-ocean-in-the-1990s/articleshow/81708512.cms) that let loose thousands of rubber ducks into the ocean? Maybe these ducks were a secret messaging system used by human traffickers, much like homing pigeons?

Another saddening Ever Given conspiracy was started recently, claiming that the captain of the stuck container ship was Egypt’s [first female ship’s captain](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-56615521). It looks like this baseless claim, easily disproven by the fact that she was hundreds of miles away on another ship, was likely concocted as a way of discrediting a successful woman in a Muslim country where women are often considered to be second class citizens.
