[Kyle Chapman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Chapman_(New_Zealand_activist)), ex head of the New Zealand National Front, is planning to [distribute leaflets](https://www.facebook.com/kerry.coffin.35/posts/1194222714342415) about the COVID vaccine in New Zealand:

Thankfully the claims in this pamphlet are pretty easy to debunk:

The COVID death rates in the pamphlet are way lower than reality, where in China, South Korea, Italy and Spain the death rate of the 70+ are not 0.24% as quoted in the leaflet, but around 8% - rising to 15% for those over 80. And for younger people, it’s not a blanket 0.24%, but rather the rate increases with age - from around 0.2% of people in their 30s to just below 1% of those in their 50s.

The COVID vaccine death/injury rate of 5% is just plain nonsense, and part of a raft of misinformation circulating on the internet:

The Israeli Health Minister quote about the vaccine killing 40 times more elderly than the virus is flat out wrong, and the 260 times more younger people part wasn’t even in the original false rumour, and must have been attached, Chinese whispers style, at a later date:

The Bill Gates quote, in full and in context, does not talk about lowering the global population. Rather it is about slowing population growth, and in a talk about CO2 levels:

> "First, we've got population. The world today has 6.8 billion people. That's headed up to about nine billion. Now, if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that by, perhaps, 10 or 15 percent. But there, we see an increase of about 1.3."

The list of references at the bottom of the pamphlet is a who’s who of vaccine misinformation. Robert Kennedy Jr, Sherri Tenpenny, Dolores Cahill, Joe Mercola, The Highwire and our local science denying outfit COVID Plan B.
