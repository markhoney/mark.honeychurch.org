Disappointingly, [despite the excitement](https://www.9news.com.au/videos/national/uf-os-melbourne-residents-left-baffled-after-light-display-resembles-unidentified-flying-objects/cknfpy8w8005p0hksht28fe62), I’m sure many listeners will already have figured out what the rational explanation for this string of lights in the sky over Melbourne was: Elon Musk’s Starlink, a company that is providing satellite based internet - with a few tens of thousands of satellites planned to be deployed over the next few years. There are valid questions about whether these devices are damaging to astronomy, and have the potential to clutter earth’s orbit, but they’re definitely not visiting aliens. If you are able to get out and see these satellites as they maneuver themselves into their operational orbits, I’d definitely recommend it. I saw them late last year, and it was an impressive sight - a real testament to modern technology.
