TV psychic [Maurice Amdur](https://www.mauriceamdur.co.uk/), in the UK, [has a video](https://www.facebook.com/MauricesPsychicWorld/videos/1255529411231934) featured on his public Facebook page - Maurice’s Psychic World - where he performs a psychic reading of a car salesman while he’s picking up a brand new Jaguar XKS convertible, worth eighty thousand pounds:

Some time after receiving the car, in 2015, someone rear-ended Maurice at the Marble Arch roundabout and damaged not only his eighty grand status symbol, but also apparently his health.

A while after the accident, Maurice sued the insurance company of the driver of the other car, Ilya Krylov, claiming that his injuries had been so bad that he had been unable to provide psychic readings to clients for two years - apparently he “struggled with the intense concentration required to predict the future”. He also supposedly suffered impotence.

Because of this revenue loss, Maurice was asking for £250,000 in compensation from the insurance company. Instead, last week a judge ordered Maurice to pay an estimated £100,000 in legal costs, citing “fundamental dishonesty”. It turns out that this tricky psychic had been sneakily giving readings to clients during the time he said his psychic powers were rendered useless - at £450 an hour.

This is a 1-2 blow for a psychic who says he has the ability to see the future. What a bad advertisement for his psychic abilities that he was unable to see either the car crash or the lawsuit defeat coming. I can’t say I’m surprised - having watched a few of his readings, he doesn’t seem to be a very good psychic, often guessing star signs wrong and talking more about himself than the person he’s reading for.
