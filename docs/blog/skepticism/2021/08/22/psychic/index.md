This oneâ€™s a little light hearted, and not overly surprising - Kelvin Cruickshank, one of our most famous local psychics, appears to have failed to have been warned by the spirits about the impending lockdown. Kelvyn had booked a live event for Thursday in New Plymouth, in what turned out to be the second day of our national lockdown. David Chisholm, a member of our Facebook group, managed to [take a great screenshot](https://www.facebook.com/groups/nzskeptics/posts/10158133853147761/) of the event being advertised under a large banner warning of event date changes due to our COVID lockdown.
