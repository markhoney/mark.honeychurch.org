When I started with gen-i, I provided 2nd and 3rd level support for the ANZ National Bank throughout New Zealand. This support involved both completing work requests and fault fixing. Work requests included maintaining the **Active Directory** environment, providing network shares, building PCs and installing software. Fault fixing covered the whole range of the bank's IT hardware and software, with the hardware mainly consisting of **Compaq/HP** and **Dell** servers, PCs and Laptops, and software running to hundreds of packages. Issues dealt with ranged from dial-up and broadband problems, through OS and application faults to **Exchange** and Active Directory problems.

After several months in the role, I became Technical Lead of gen-i's ANZ Server Support team, looking after all ANZ and NBNZ production servers. This involved a mixture of projects and day-to-day administration of branch and corporate servers, including **backups**, hardware and software problems and routine maintenance. Faults were fixed within SLA and, in alignment with **ITIL** best practice, problem records were created and root causes diagnosed and repaired. Incidents ranged from the relatively simple, such as hardware failures, to the complex, such as troubleshooting NDMP backup problems.

As well as supporting the environment, I supported the other server engineers on the contract – helping with technical issues, running weekly meetings and distributing work when required. I encouraged engineers to gain qualifications and aided them where possible.

#### Projects

**_RightFax Upgrade._** I ran a project to migrate existing RightFax users to a new infrastructure. This process involved the building of new RightFax servers, installation of **Microsoft SQL clusters** (including setup of SAN disks) in both Production and DR environments and the subsequent migration of Fax mailboxes between servers.
