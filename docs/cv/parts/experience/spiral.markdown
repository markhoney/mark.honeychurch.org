![CVLogo](../logos/work/spiral.jpg) [Spiral Technology](http://www.spiraltechnology.co.uk/) _London, England_ (2003-03 - 2004-11)

During my four years in London a business partner and I set up a company specialising in supplying cost effective IT solutions using mainly Open Source components. Through this work I have a solid understanding of Linux and Content Management Systems, eCommerce Solutions, Photo Galleries and other applications.

I have also been involved in the costing of contracts, responding to tenders, filing of tax returns and many other facets of running a company. I have liaised with customers throughout the life-cycle of delivering a product – both third-party and bespoke – from initial specification to deployment and beyond.
