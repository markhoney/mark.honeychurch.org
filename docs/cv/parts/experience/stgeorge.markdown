### Network Analyst

![CVLogo](../../logos/work/stgeorge.jpg) [St. George Bank](https://www.stgeorge.com.au/) _Sydney, Australia_ (1999-04 - 1999-11)

My role at St. George was providing third level support for the Client Server Technical Systems (CSTS) Department. As such I was part of a team delivering support to the Core Network File Servers and associated software using **Novell Netware** servers and **Novell Directory Services**. This support was both for the Kogarah Head Office (2500 users), and a distributed branch infrastructure across Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia (8000 users).

On top of this support I administered the ISYS helpdesk system, a database of helpdesk calls. Problems relevant to the team were either resolved by myself or delegated by me to another member of the team. This provided work on a wide range of problems throughout the bank. Frequent problems included IP conflict troubleshooting, restoring of data from ARCserve and ADSM backups and fixing printer problems.

#### Projects

**_Automation._** Having found that several batch files and other scripts were being run to copy files cross the network, I created a program in Delphi to allow automated file distribution over the LAN. The program allowed the user to create multiple jobs and specify which files to copy, where from/to and when/how often.

**_Ebank Rollout._** St. George’s new Electronic Banking system (EBank) occasionally had IP-related problems with client networks, which I was tasked with troubleshooting. I designed and built a test network to help pinpoint potential problems, and then helped to write a questionnaire designed to discover which clients would most likely encounter problems. After talking to clients’ IT personnel on the phone to build a clear picture of how their network was set up, I would advise the installation team on any special installation requirements. If an installation still had problems, I would personally visit the client site and troubleshoot their network in order to resolve the conflict.
