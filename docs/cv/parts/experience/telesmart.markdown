At Telesmart I develop software products for both in-house and customer consumption, using modern tooling and libraries to deliver high quality solutions.

#### Projects

**_Customer Portal._** I designed and developed a Customer Portal utilising a **NuxtJS** and **Vuetify** frontend, with secure authorisation using **JSON Web Tokens**. The backend infrastructure consists of a set of **Federated** Apollo **GraphQL** Microservices, with PassportJS and third party **OAuth** authentication strategies. **Lerna** is used for monorepo management, along with **MongoDB** and **Redis** for data storage. All The code is deployed to **virtualisation** containers hosted on a **Docker Swarm**, using an automated build pipeline. All together, the project contains 11 scalable microservices and 14 custom written private Node modules.
