At Telesmart I develop software products for both in-house and customer consumption, using modern tooling and libraries to deliver high quality solutions.

#### Projects

**_Customer Portal._** I have created a Customer Portal utilising a **NuxtJS** and **Vuetify** frontend, with secure authorisation using **JSON Web Tokens**. The backend infrastructure I have implemented consists of a set of **Federated** Apollo **GraphQL** Microservices, along with Passport and third party **OAuth** authentication strategies, and **MongoDB** and **Redis** data stores. The code is deployed to **virtualisation** containers hosted on a **Docker Swarm**.

As part of this work, I have written and published several Open Source projects, including an **NeDB** Apollo Server Cache plugin and a server side Apollo DataSource plugin for **ConnectWise**.
