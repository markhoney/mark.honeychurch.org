As Chair (2014-2017) and Committee Member (2013-2014, 2017-) of the **[NZ Skeptics](http://skeptics.nz)**, Co-founder and Chair of the **[Society for Science Based Healthcare](http://sbh.nz)** (2013-), President (2014-2015) and Council Member (2013-2014, 2015-) of the **[Humanist Society](http://humanist.nz/)**, Council Member (2016-) of the **[NZARH](http://rationalists.nz/)** and Treasurer (2015-2019) and Board Member (2019-) of **[Making Sense of Fluoride](http://msof.nz/)**, I have spent much of my free time protecting the public against untrue claims made by psychics, conspiracy theorists and purveyors of alternative medicine, and helping to protect the rights and freedoms of New Zealanders. As Co-founder and Board Member (2013-2018) of **[CoderDojo New Zealand](http://coderdojo.nz/)**, I enjoy teaching local kids how to code. I am no stranger to being in the media, and had the good fortune to have had a regular national radio segment called [Skeptical Thoughts with Mark Honeychurch](https://www.radiolive.co.nz/home/shows/weekend-variety-wireless-with-graeme-hill/skeptical-thoughts.html) (since 2015), where I talk about skepticism.
