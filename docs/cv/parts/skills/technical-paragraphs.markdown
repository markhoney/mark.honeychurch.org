I have a wide experience and knowledge of operating systems, software and hardware. I am certified on both Windows and Linux, and have experience with cloud services and container based virtualisation.

I have coded solutions in [PHP](https://www.php.net/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/), but in recent years have been developing [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) software (using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), along with libraries such as [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/), [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), [NuxtJS](https://nuxtjs.org/) and [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/)).

I use both SQL and NoSQL databases ([MS SQL](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server), [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)/[MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)), and [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5) and [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets), along with several popular HTML/CSS frameworks (including [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [Material](https://material.io/)). I have experience supporting server, network and storage hardware.

I am competent in data processing and analysis, and where possible use my programming knowledge to create reusable data analysis tools.
