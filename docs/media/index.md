# Media

## Talk to me

If you would like my opinion on a topic of skeptical interest, please feel free to [contact me](/contact/). I'm happy to give my opinion as Media Spokesperson for the [NZ Skeptics](https://skeptics.nz), Vice President of [Humanist NZ](https://humanist.nz) or Chair of the [Society for Science Based Healthcare](https://sbh.nz).

### Mugshots

If you've already talked to me and you're looking for a high quality photo to use to go along with my rambling, check out [this page](/media/me/) for a few images that are free to use and don't make me look like a total eejit.

## Mentioned, quoted, interviewed

As a part of the roles I've taken on working for charities such as the [NZ Skeptics](https://skeptics.nz), [Humanist NZ](https://humanist.nz) and the [Society for Science Based Healthcare](http://sbh.nz), I'm occasionally asked for my opinion on various topics. Sometimes a project I've been working on also makes it into the media. Here are the times that I've been mentioned in the media that I can find online:

#### Skepticism Today

For a while myself and some friends from Skeptics in the Pub created our own podcast, [Skepticism Today](http://skepticism.today/). It was great fun, but unfortunately the amount of work it took to record edit the podcast took its toll. I'm still hoping to resurrect the show at some point.
