            <description><![CDATA[A friend recently let me know of a tiny program that runs a 3D scene with both audio and video. The executable, a .com file, is 64 bytes in size (yeah, that's pretty damn small!), and the camera angle is a flyover of a grassy field with a blue sky above. The audio is a single note played once, overlaid with the sound of a helicopter's whirring blades and a periodic swooshing noise that sounds like the wind. It seems too amazing to be real, especially when you've seen the video:]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[I was cleaning up my music collection yesterday by using Discogs, a great online Discography catalogue website, to download missing album cover art. I normally use the long-windedly named Album Cover Art Downloader to download cover art, as it's pretty good and can grab images from various sources (amazon.com, yahoo, buy.com) - but there are some albums, especially bootlegs and the like, that aren't on Amazon. While using Discogs I saw that they have artist images (such as the one on the right), and started to download these to use like Album Art images, by naming the file folder.jpg and placing it in the artist's folder (My music collection is organised by First Letter\Artist\Album, e.g. A\Aphex Twin\Hangable Autobulb).]]></description>

The reason I'm changing is primarily so that I can use ZFS, which NexentaStor utilises (as it's a Solaris-based appliance). This is similar to NetApp's WAFL filesystem (and is currently the reason for a spate of lawsuits between Sun and NetApp), and so should offer decent performance benefits.]]></description>

Of course I think it would be good to have this law repealed, and I am working with the Humanist Society (of which I am currently the President) to pressure the NZ government to repeal the law. Various blasphemy laws exist in many countries around the world, including Canada and Ireland as well as here in NZ.]]></description>

I've just passed my Microsoft 070-299: Implementing and Administering Security in a Microsoft Windows Server 2003 Network exam, which is the last exam I'll be taking until after Karen has left for England at the end of July. With this exam, I am now MCSA + Security certified. This complements the other Microsoft, Linux, NetApp, etc exams I have taken in the last few months.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Domain Registrars seem to be willing to resort to some pretty underhanded tactics when it comes to making money from you. Often the price offered for a domain name for the first year changes for subsequent years, quietly and without warning. A £10 domain name can become a £20 domain name with no explanation, for example.]]></description>

It was great to be able to listen and observe, and I spent the time messaging an ex Jehovah's Witness friend and asking him to fill in some details about what I was seeing. It was great to get an insider's perspective of the event and the kinds of people who become Jehovah's Witnesses.]]></description>

I learned tricks to work around this - I kept the letter D in my copy buffer, and if I clicked the X key before clicking C, it would make it more likely for the C to work. I'd then just have to delete the X that I had typed. This quickly became second nature to me, but there were limitations.]]></description>

Both are very thorough, and between them they're steered me through LPI 101 and 102, but as I'd paid good money to have the O'Reilly book shipped over from the USA (don't even get me started on book prices over here in New Zealand!) I was disappointed when studying the 201 materials to find that the quality is lower than that for the 10x exams. After sending in a support request, O'Reilly support were nice enough to point me to the errata page, which I have now spotted as a link on the left of O'Reilly's page for the book.]]></description>

Moose and moa were mulled over. I was also asked about Shuzi Qi, as the Australian Skeptics had a good result a few years ago dealing with them, and would like to see the NZ Skeptics attempting something similar. Skeptics in the Pub was mentioned, and we talked about how popular our local pub meetings are. Something else that came up was the new look of the NZ Skeptics, with a new journal, logo and website - but I'll cover that in more detail in a future post.]]></description>

A great place to keep an eye on these quakes (and to make sure that what you just experienced was an earthquake and not something more sinister, such as the unlikely event of a terrorist attack) is GeoNet.

Despite an automatic response from Trademe saying that I'd receive a proper response within 24 hours, I still haven't heard anything back. I have noticed, though, that most of the auctions (apart from the one for Proficient PM Software, which strangely keeps being advertised in the Vintage Computers section) have now been removed. From what I can tell, this guy has been on a VMware course recently, and has now discovered VMware's Virtual Appliances. For example, the Proficient PM Software above, which seems to be a fairly obscure piece of software from Technology for Solutions, has been released as a Virtual Appliance.]]></description>

This appears to be a very good move, as fluoridation is a health issue and DHBs are much better suited to weighing up the pros and cons than local councils are. Councils in NZ have historically been bamboozled by Fluoride Free NZ, our local anti fluoride group, and have in some cases made decisions to remove fluoride.]]></description>

As a result of the complaint, we uncovered the fact that Medsafe &quot;grandfathered&quot; in over a thousand of Weleda's homeopathic products. Medsafe registered these products as medicines without checking if there was evidence that they work, and despite a general understanding within science that homeopathy is ineffective. All they checked for is that there were no records of the products being unsafe, and given that homeopathy is normally nothing more than sugar pills or sugar water there were unlikely to have been any safety issues.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[I recently found out that a movement which is popular in America has reached our shores. The Freeman movement, otherwise known as Sovereign Citizens, consists of people who believe that it is possible to declare yourself no longer beholden to the laws of your country, and not liable to pay taxes. Normally the process involves filling in obscure government forms, opting out of government forms of ID such as driving licenses and passports and writing signed declarations using lots of very big legal sounding words.]]></description>

Back then the device was made from a piece of sewage pipe spray painted black, with several blue LEDs around the top. We were told to believe that the device was emitting &quot;scalar waves&quot; (a pseudo-scientific idea) on the Solfeggio frequencies. I sat there for half an hour while the device went through a range of these frequencies, supposedly healing areas of my life.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[I've found another fun conspiracy theory - V2K. Weirdly, it stands for &quot;Voice to Skull&quot; and is a technology where voices can be beamed directly to your head. This is another conspiracy theory that until recently was new to me. The idea is based on the fact that microwaves can be used to create a clicking noise inside someone's head. This is known as the microwave auditory effect, and was discovered in World War Two by people who worked near radar devices. The likely mechanism for the clicking is that parts of the inner ear are being rapidly heated up by the radio waves. The microwaves can be varied to create what sounds like a human voice inside someone's head, which is pretty cool.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[As we talked about at the end of last year, there's been a real push to sell Kangen Water devices in NZ recently. An article in the Herald recently has detailed Ainsley Brunton's efforts to sell the water in Whanganui to unsuspecting customers. Her water devices are selling for $4,000, with promises that the water can help with cancer, diabetes and other serious diseases. Enagic in Australia is selling the machines to New Zealanders who are passing them on, and Enagic's prices for a machine that does nothing useful to water vary between $2,300 and $6,500.]]></description>

Craig Wright, called the Spirit Whisperer, has been offering his services in NZ for several years, and has even worked on a pilot for a TV show with Sue Nicholson. Now he's been found guilty of indecent assault of a teenager after performing a &quot;ritual cleansing&quot;. Craig's defence was that he puts his finger in someone's belly button to find out if they are possessed by an entity. When he asserted that the victim had this problem, he took him to another room to rid him of the spiritual attachment and that is when the assault took place.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[You may ask what blasphemy has to do with skepticism - often I've talked with people about the intersection of skepticism and religious belief. I feel that religion should never be above skeptical scrutiny. A common question asked of the Skeptics Society is whether someone can be both an atheist and a skeptic - I always say that yes, someone can be both, but that I believe it requires the person to avoid shining a skeptical light on their belief. Skeptics usually stand by the idea that nothing is above questioning, and so a skeptic who isn't willing to scrutinise their religious beliefs seems to be a strange case to me. We should have no sacred cows.]]></description>

Of course, there's more to this story - isn't there always. In this case, the woman used both cannabis oil and chemotherapy to fight her cancer - no prizes for guessing which of those two will have helped her more. It also turns out that cancer was only &quot;terminal&quot; if the woman had not received any treatment. This is not what is normally considered to be a diagnosis of terminal cancer - terminal usually means that the cancer is not treatable with medicine, not that the cancer is not treatable without medicine.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[SleepDrops is a New Zealand company which sells small vials of liquid drops which are supposed to help you get to sleep and stay asleep. Their ingredients are a mixture of small doses of herbs and very small (homeopathic) doses of herbs. A look at the Scientific Research page on their website shows that there’s a dearth of research for any of the ingredients in the SleepDrops products, and absolutely no research on the SleepDrops formulation.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[There were hundreds of Christians at Parliament on Tuesday calling for the reinstatement of the name of Jesus in parliament’s prayer. There were people wearing Make America Great Again hats, bikers in leathers proclaiming the lord, and some pretty horrendous banners - including one calling Speaker of the House Trevor Mallard a “dishonourable Judas”.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[A few weeks ago the Wellington Skeptics made their annual pilgrimage to the Go Green Expo. Billed as a Green Living and Sustainable Lifestyle Show, in reality the majority of stands push nonsense alternative therapies, making illegal medical claims about cherry juice, magnetic bracelets and turmeric shakes and scaring people about the dangers of dirty electricity, blue light, toxins and chemicals. There are also talks with titles such as:]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[On Wednesday a group of us skeptics visited the Ark Man, Rod Walsh, who has been over in New Zealand from Australia on tour. Rod’s schtick is that god told him in the ‘90s to build a scale model of Noah’s Ark from Genesis. Apparently the day after he was told this by god, he turned on the radio and two people were having a conversation about the ark - which proved to him that god’s voice had been real. Rod has now built 6 scale replicas of Noah’s Ark over the last 20 years, and has been touring the world with his scale models since the ‘90s.]]></description>

Anything and everything has been fair game, and I've tried to mix a skeptical critique of news stories with some field work - going out and visiting various weird and wonderful places and groups and talking about my experiences.]]></description>
