Over the years I've written some bad code, and some okay code. But one constant is that I've always enjoyed writing code, and always enjoyed the challenge of learning new languages and libraries.

I guess I started learning to code at primary school with [Logo](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)>), before dabbling with [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC) in secondary school. At University I learned [Pascal](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)>) and [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B).

Since then I've learned, to varying degrees of competence (and in roughly chronological order): [VBA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_for_Applications), [Perl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl), [PHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP), [KiXtart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KiXtart), [Rexx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rexx), [Python](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)>), [C](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)>), [C#](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)>), [Javascript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript).

Here are some of the projects I've worked on.
