A friend asked in the [NZ Skeptics Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/nzskeptics/) about skeptics' star signs. He suggested (tongue in cheek) that maybe, given the personality types of many skeptics, that this would be reflected in our star signs. Rather than pooh-poohing the idea, we decided to collect the star signs of as many skeptics in the group as we could, and threw the results in a google sheet.

Here are some graphs showing the results. It's interesting to see that, after I had looked for different ways to group the data, one graph in particular (grouping by Element) showed an interesting skew. My suspicion is that this is nothing more than fishing for significance. Randomness is clumpy, and with such a small sample size (61) there's bound to be the appearance of significance, even if the data is truly random.

And of course, there's been absolutely no effort to try to ensure that a representative sample of skeptics answered the questionnaire - maybe those who fit the already popular star signs were more compelled to add their data point to the spreadsheet and influence the result than those whose star signs were added by fewer skeptics early on in the project. Maybe skeptics lied about their star sign to invalidate the experiment, potentially because of a dislike of astrology.

Hover over the charts to see numbers, percents and any missing labels.
