[Apparently](http://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2015/09/22/growing-number-believe-californias-drought-is-a-government-conspiracy/) the current drought in California is a conspiracy.

Dane Wigington, lead researcher for GeoEngineering Watch says:

> "Climate engineering is the single greatest assault on the environment ever launched by humanity, without question,"

> "The list of corroborating material we have is immense, including lab tests that prove the same elements named in geoengineering patentsâ€”aluminum, barium, and other heavy metals are raining down on us in massive quantities,"

A side effect of this is that rainfall is being blocked, causing a drought.

This is related to chemtrails, and we have our own NZ group who regularly take pictures of aeroplane contrails claiming that the government is using them for mind control, population control or other nefarious reasons.
