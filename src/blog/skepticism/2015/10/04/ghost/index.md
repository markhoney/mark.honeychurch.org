A crew member felt their trousers being tugged, the bottom of someone's seat was kicked, a chandelier prop worked intermittently, and a hat was knocked off

Seven Sharp brought a clairvoyant in, Chrissy Hollamby, who "detected" 3 spirits. She tried out the chair - and felt a poke in the back of the neck.

If you sit someone in a chair, and they expect something spooky to happen, it's unsurprising when something happens.

Chrissy says the spirits move with the show - but of course there's no evidence of this.
