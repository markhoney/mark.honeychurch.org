Former accountant turned psychic [took $250 thousand](http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/74733853/marlborough-clairvoyant-steals-from-elderly-couple) from an elderly couple in a rest home who had been friends with him for 30 years. The money was taken over a period of 12 years.

Just lost his appeal for continued name suppression.

Terence Harnett first had the couple hand over blank cheques, and then convinced them to to sign an "appointment of agent" document giving him direct access to their bank accounts.

The couple's daughter became suspicious when the rest home bill was not paid, and on checking the accounts found that they had been cleared out. The daughter also said that she'd always considered Terence to be a bad clairvoyant as he was always getting things wrong (like every other psychic?!!)

> "I had arguments with my family about it ... I'd watched him do readings and they were never correct. He'd do those feel-good readings on TV. It was pathetic."

He also invested more than $350 thousand of their money in a failed ponzi scheme

He's serving a sentence in a rest home, which the daughter says is the worst place to put him.
