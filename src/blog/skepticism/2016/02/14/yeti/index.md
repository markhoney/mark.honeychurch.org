There is a [one second shaky video](http://www.ksl.com/?sid=38448957&nid=711) of a Yeti, along with a higher resolution picture.

> "This morning skiing in Formigal with friends, we've come across this. What the hell is it? A bear or a Yeti? We've told the ski resort, but they haven't taken us seriously. I bet there's something on the loose out there. I know what I saw."

The resort said:

> "We have spoken to the witnesses of the sighting ... and after combing the area, we have found nothing. We believe, therefore, that there is no cause for alarm and that visitors' security is guaranteed. In any case, we will remain alert."

The video was faked to create a social media storm for sunglasses brand Hawkers. Their campaign reads

> "Yeti is back with Hawkers and Aramon".

Hawkers = Sunglasses

Aramon = Ski Resort

A spokesman for Aramon said: "We wanted to draw attention and make a lot of noise this season so we knew that working with Hawkers would be the perfect bet."

Alex Morano, the chief executive of Hawkers, said the campaign was "great fun".
