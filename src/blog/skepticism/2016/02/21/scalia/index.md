Antonin Scalia, a conservative Supreme Court judge in the US, died this week at age 79. Scalia took some strange legal views in his time, such as this one on evolution:

> The body of scientific evidence supporting creation science is as strong as that supporting evolution. In fact, it may be stronger…. The evidence for evolution is far less compelling than we have been led to believe. Evolution is not a scientific "fact," since it cannot actually be observed in a laboratory. Rather, evolution is merely a scientific theory or "guess."… It is a very bad guess at that. The scientific problems with evolution are so serious that it could accurately be termed a "myth."…

> Creation science is educationally valuable…

Scalia has multiple health problems, including heart trouble and high blood pressure. His death was not surprising.

There are already conspiracy theories about Scalia's death this week. The issue of what was meant by Scalia having a pillow "over" his head has lead Donald Trump to suggest that he died under suspicious circumstances. Donald goes far enough to suggest there's a conspiracy, but knows not to make any definite claims.

> "And it's a horrible topic. But they say they found a pillow on his face, which is a pretty unusual place to find a pillow. I can't tell you what—I can't give you an answer. You know, usually I like to give you answers. But I literally just heard it a little while ago. It's just starting to come out now, as you know, Michael."

More crazily, pastor Rick Wiles thinks that numerology proves that Obama was to blame:

> "The 13th was the 44th day of 2016. Obama is the 44th president of the United States, so you have this numerology thing taking place."

> "They "deliberately left the pillow on his face as a message to everybody else: 'Don't mess with us, we can murder a justice and get away with it.' Deep down they know, the regime murdered a justice … This is the way a dictatorial, fascist, police state regime takes control of a nation. Barack Obama is the most lawless president we have ever had in the history of this great country."
