Rush Limbaugh, US radio talk show host, has used a [conversation about Harambe the gorilla](http://www.rawstory.com/2016/05/confused-rush-limbaugh-thinks-evolution-is-a-hoax-because-cincinnati-gorilla-never-became-human/) to argue that evolution does not work.

Audio clip available above, from 1:48 to 2:33:

> "A lot of people think that all of us used to be apes. Don't doubt me on this. A lot of people think that all of us used to be gorillas. And they're looking for the missing link out there - the evolution crowd. They think we were originally apes."

"If we were the original apes, then how come Harambe is still an ape and how come he didn't become one of us?"

This is such a tired old argument against evolution, but it's something that Christians have asked me in the past. It's an easy sentence to throw at someone, but normally takes more than one sentence to counter it, explaining about how evolution works on populations, not individuals, how species branch rather than all evolve linearly in the same direction, that physical separation can cause this branching, etc.

A nice, simple rebuttal is replying with:

"If dogs are domesticated wolves, how come there are still wolves?"
