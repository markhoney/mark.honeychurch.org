Tom appears to be staying in the band, but is going to spend more time looking into UFOs and other weird and wonderful conspiracy ideas.

> "I couldn't tell the band I was working with people in the government," he says. "That's another big part of this story. People think I want to just put out a novel and make a movie. I have 10 people that I'm working with that are at the highest levels of the Department of Defense and NASA and the military."
