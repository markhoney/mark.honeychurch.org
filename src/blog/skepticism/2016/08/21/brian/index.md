I looked into Roberts. He's an ex-mining consultant, and a member of Pauline Hanson's One Nation party. He has said some silly things in the past about climate change:

> "Burning coal... cannot raise CO2 levels as levels are determined by Nature"

He seems to be paranoid about Agenda 21 - a paranoia I last heard from David Icke. He said:

> "The UN IPCC's unfounded core claim about human CO2 is part of UN Agenda 21 campaign for global governance"

> "We now know WHY they push climate fraud. They're pushing global control."

He's also worried about the World Wildlife Federation:

> "WWF is a UN agent pushing global governance and funded by major foundations connected with international bankers. Its antihuman agenda does not protect the environment"

Brian asked Malcolm if he also thought NASA faked the moon landings, which Malcolm seemed quite upset about - however, given his paranoid views, I don't think the question was untoward.
