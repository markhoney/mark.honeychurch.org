Obviously people around the world are painfully aware of the many crazy beliefs held by president-elect Donald Trump. However, what's less well known is the range of nonsense that Mike Pence, America's future Vice President, believes.

Mike was responsible for enacting Indiana's "Religious Freedom Restoration Act", which allowed for discrimination on religious grounds. Religious shop owners in Indiana were then able to refuse service to gay customers, for example.

On evolution, Pence said:

> "I believe with all my heart that God created the heavens and the earth, the seas and all that's in them." and "... I also believe that someday scientists will come to see that only the theory of intelligent design provides even a remotely rational explanation for the known universe."

Pence is a supporter of abstinence only sex education, which has been shown to be ineffective. He also thinks that gay people do not deserve equal rights, and believes in the use of gay conversion therapy - another "solution" shown to be ineffective. He even suggested diverting funding from HIV prevention programs in order to pay for this therapy for gay people.

He has said that "Global warming is a myth" and that "the earth is actually cooler today than it was about 50 years ago"
