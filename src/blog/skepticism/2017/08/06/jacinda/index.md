Vinny's idea seems to be that because she's, possibly, received a scholarship from the Freemasons, she must be connected to them in some shadowy way. Of course, this goes hand in hand with the idea that the Freemasons are a secretive underground political group planning to overthrow the world's governments, or quietly running the world.
