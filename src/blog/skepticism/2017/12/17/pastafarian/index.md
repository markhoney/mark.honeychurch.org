Adding legitimacy to the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, the first citizenship [has just taken place](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/99910254/church-of-the-flying-spaghetti-monster-breaks-another-milestone-in-new-zealand) with a new citizen wearing a colander on his head. Bjorn Oback, from Germany, wore a colander in Hamilton recently.

This follows on from several people wearing colanders on driving license photos, the registration of a Pastafarian marriage celebrant and a Pastafarian wedding. It appears that nobody has yet had a passport made with a colander on their head, but presumably it's just a matter of time.
