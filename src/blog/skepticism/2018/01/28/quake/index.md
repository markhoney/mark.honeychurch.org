Frank Hoogerbeets from the Netherlands has [predicted a major earthquake](http://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2018/01/man-s-huge-quake-prediction-is-fearmongering-geonet.html) of 8 or 9 in the first week of March. His predictions says that "electromagnetic amplifications caused by planetary alignments" will increase seismic activity, and that this will be caused by the alignment of 6 planets.

He then goes on to say that the 1960 Chilean earthquake (M9.5), the 1964 Alaska earthquake (M9.2) and the 2004 Sumatra earthquake (M9.3) all occurred around the time of similar alignments.

There's a [rare "supermoon"](http://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2018/01/super-blue-blood-moon-nz-to-witness-extremely-rare-event.html) on Wednesday, a Super Blue Blood Moon. The Super means that the full moon is slightly closer to the earth. A Blue Moon means it's the second full moon in a month. A Blood Moon means that an eclipse will cause the moon to be lit by light shining through the earth's atmosphere, which will filter out the blue end of the spectrum and allow more red through - causing the moon to look red.
