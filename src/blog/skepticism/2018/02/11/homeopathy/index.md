Georgian College in Toronto has [cancelled a course in homeopathy](http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/georgian-college-diploma-homeopathy-pseudoscience-1.4529339), due to negative feedback.

The proposed new course was going to cost about $5,000 a term, and included a module on homeopathic vaccines - known as nosodes. Nosodes are usually an extremely diluted form of a secretion from the disease being vaccinated against - pus, phlegm, etc.

The college told CBC news when asked that they weren't planning to shut down the course, despite a public outcry - saying it had been through:

> "an extensive and rigorous academic approval process."

Hours later they reversed that decision.
