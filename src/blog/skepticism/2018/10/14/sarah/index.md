The Aussies have just had their skeptics conference, and have [given out a Bent Spoon award](https://www.skeptics.com.au/2018/10/13/a-bad-day-for-sarah/) to Sarah Stevenson, for her Sarah's Day brand of nonsense.

Sarah has claimed that she managed to cure a case of cervical dysplasia with:

> "the power of natural medicine, food, lifestyle changes and prayer"

The Cancer Council of Australia disputes Sarah's claims, saying:

> "there is no evidence that there is anything a woman can do in terms of diet and lifestyle that promotes regression".

The [Sarah's Day website](https://www.sarahsday.com/) has selling of her products front and centre, with 100 page eBooks for AU$70. It looks like she's an up and coming alternative lifestyle brand, so I expect to see her in the news for her nonsense some more over the next few years.

The Therapeutics Goods Administration (TGA) in Australia were also in the running for a Bent Spoon, for making the same mistake the World Health Organisation is currently in the process of making - giving legitimacy to conditions and diagnoses based on pseudoscientific claptrap such as Traditional Chinese Medicine, Acupuncture and Homeopathy.
