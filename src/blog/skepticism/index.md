title: Skeptical Thoughts with Mark Honeychurch
---

I've been very fortunate to have been allowed to talk on the radio for the last few years, on the topic of skepticism. Anything and everything has been fair game, and I've tried to mix a skeptical critique of news stories with some field work - going out and visiting various weird and wonderful places and groups and talking about my experiences.

Here are my notes from the show, which I tended to write a few hours before I went live. I didn't often use the notes while I was on air, but they helped me to sort out my thoughts. Some of these are fully typed up, but others (especially when I've had limited time after an event to put my thoughts together) are just lists of talking points.
