## Background

I have spent the last twelve years working for an Australian company, Interactive, both as a hardware support engineer and a fullstack software developer. Prior to that I worked as a systems support engineer. Now that Interactive have decided to close their Wellington office, I am looking for a full-time permanent or contract role, working in either development or support.

## Competencies

I am a creative problem solver, and enjoy being given challenging tasks. I like to use my critical thinking skills to come up with novel but practical solutions to complex problems, and am able to see projects through design and implementation to completion. I am a keen and quick learner, and can research topics and synthesise new information quickly. I enjoy using new technologies, and always seek to know more. I am methodical in my work, and am happy working to deadlines.

I am a capable communicator, and am comfortable building and maintaining relationships with both internal and external stakeholders.

I have a wide experience and knowledge of operating systems, software and hardware. I am certified on both Windows and Linux, and have experience with cloud services and container based virtualisation. I have coded solutions in [PHP](https://www.php.net/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/), but in recent years have been developing [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) software (using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), along with libraries such as [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/), [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), [NuxtJS](https://nuxtjs.org/) and [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/)). I use both SQL and NoSQL databases ([MS SQL](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server), [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)/[MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)), and [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5) and [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets), along with several popular HTML/CSS frameworks (including [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [Material](https://material.io/)). I have experience supporting server, network and storage hardware.

I am competent in data processing and analysis, and where possible use my programming knowledge to create reusable data analysis tools.

## Education

I have a Master's degree in Engineering, and hold a variety of professional certifications relevant to my career in IT.

### M.Eng (Hons)

![CVLogo](./logos/education/bristol.jpg) [_University of Bristol_](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering/) **Master's Degree with Honours in Mechanical Engineering** (1994 - 1998)

**Chess Playing Robot.** In the third year of my degree, I completed my thesis on a chess-playing robot. This involved extensive programming in Borland Delphi, as well as VAL, a language used to control the PUMA 450 robot arm. During the project I had to work with a CCD camera and video capture software/hardware.

**FEA Software.** My fourth year thesis was on the writing of a Finite Element Analysis package for use within the University. It primarily involved programming in Borland C++ Builder, although parts of a previous year’s program in Visual C++ were also integrated.

## Work Experience

### Hardware Engineer, Software Engineer

![CVLogo](./logos/work/interactive.jpg) [Interactive](https://interactive.com.au) _Wellington, NZ_ (2007-10 – 2019-10)

My primary role at Interactive was in hardware support, providing a first class service to our New Zealand customers. I covered **HP**, **IBM**, **Dell** and **Sun** servers, as well as **Cisco** networking equipment and **NetApp** and **PureStorage** storage hardware. I installed and supported hardware for many major customers across New Zealand.

During my time at Interactive I also created several software products for in-house consumption:

#### Projects

**_Business Analysis._** I created a dashboard for all Service Delivery Managers company wide, allowing them to see, at a glance, the performance of our engineers. This was accomplished with direct SQL querying of our helpdesk system’s database, along with a web-based front end using **jQuery**, **Bootstrap** and the **D3** graphing library.

**_Rostering Website._** I wrote a web-based scheduling system for Interactive's on-call rosters, using **Javascript** and **C#**.

**_Tracking System._** I coded an end-to-end tracking system for our engineers, including an enterprise **iOS app** for geolocation, a **Node.JS** and **Mongo** backend for data storage and a **Vue** frontend with websockets for displaying engineer locations and statuses, using **Docker** on **Linux** as a platform.

**_Rapid Development._** I was asked to develop a customer portal in 24 hours that would allow one of our customers to access details of their support contract with us. Using **Vue** and **Bootstrap**, and accessing existing data in **MSSQL** databases, I was able to code a secure, modern, responsive website that worked for all of our customers.

### Systems Engineer, Server Team Lead

![CVLogo](./logos/work/geni.jpg) [gen-i](https://www.sparkdigital.co.nz/) _Wellington, NZ_ (2006-04 – 2007-10)

When I started with gen-i, I provided 2nd and 3rd level support for the ANZ National Bank throughout New Zealand. This support involved both completing work requests and fault fixing. Work requests included maintaining the **Active Directory** environment, providing network shares, building PCs and installing software. Fault fixing covered the whole range of the bank's IT hardware and software, with the hardware mainly consisting of **Compaq/HP** and **Dell** servers, PCs and Laptops, and software running to hundreds of packages. Issues dealt with ranged from dial-up and broadband problems, through OS and application faults to **Exchange** and Active Directory problems.

After several months in the role, I became Technical Lead of gen-i's ANZ Server Support team, looking after all ANZ and NBNZ production servers. This involved a mixture of projects and day-to-day administration of branch and corporate servers, including **backups**, hardware and software problems and routine maintenance. Faults were fixed within SLA and, in alignment with **ITIL** best practice, problem records were created and root causes diagnosed and repaired. Incidents ranged from the relatively simple, such as hardware failures, to the complex, such as troubleshooting NDMP backup problems.

As well as supporting the environment, I supported the other server engineers on the contract – helping with technical issues, running weekly meetings and distributing work when required. I encouraged engineers to gain qualifications and aided them where possible.

#### Projects

**_RightFax Upgrade._** I ran a project to migrate existing RightFax users to a new infrastructure. This process involved the building of new RightFax servers, installation of **Microsoft SQL clusters** (including setup of SAN disks) in both Production and DR environments, and the subsequent migration of fax mailboxes between servers.

### Technician

![CVLogo](./logos/work/dia.jpg) [Department of Internal Affairs](http://www.dia.govt.nz/) _Wellington, NZ_ (2005-11 - 2006-04)

At the DIA I supported over 1,000 users in an **Active Directory** and **Lotus Notes** environment, both for the Department of Internal Affairs and the Ministry of Transport. Support was given over the telephone Nationwide, and additionally with site visits within the Wellington CBD area. PCs were generally Windows 2000, with some remote clients using **Citrix**, and the hardware used was mainly **HP/Compaq** Desktops and HP and Ricoh Printers. Supported applications included Microsoft Office, Oracle and Lotus Notes, with Checkpoint VPN-1 and iPass used for remote access.

### Voluntary Work

I have dedicated much of my spare time to working for charities, and have held the following positions:

- **Chair** of the **[NZ Skeptics](http://skeptics.nz)**
- **Secretary** of the **[Society for Science Based Healthcare](http://sbh.nz)**
- **President** of the **[Humanist Society](http://humanist.nz/)**
- **Council Member** of the **[NZARH](http://rationalists.nz/)**
- **Media Spokesperson** for the [Secular Education Network](http://religioninschools.co.nz/)
- **Treasurer** of **[Making Sense of Fluoride](http://msof.nz/)**
- **Co-founder** of **[CoderDojo New Zealand](http://coderdojo.nz/)**

Many of these roles have involved protecting the public against untrue claims made by psychics, conspiracy theorists and purveyors of alternative medicine, and has involved regularly talking with the media (newspapers, radio and TV). From 2015 to 2018 I had a regular radio segment on RadioLive called [Skeptical Thoughts with Mark Honeychurch](https://www.radiolive.co.nz/home/shows/weekend-variety-wireless-with-graeme-hill/skeptical-thoughts.html), where I talked about scientific skepticism and critical thinking.
