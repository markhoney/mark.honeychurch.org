**Chess Playing Robot.** In the third year, I completed my thesis on a chess-playing robot. This involved extensive programming in Borland Delphi, as well as VAL, a language used to control the PUMA 450 robot arm. During the project I had to work with a CCD camera and video capture software/hardware.

**FEA Software.** My fourth year thesis was on the writing of a Finite Element Analysis package for use within the University. It primarily involved programming in Borland C++ Builder, although parts of a previous yearâ€™s program in Visual C++ were also integrated.
