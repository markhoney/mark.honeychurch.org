### Network Analyst

![CVLogo](../logos/work/icarus.jpg) [Icarus Computer Systems](http://www.icarus.org.uk/) _London, England_ (2002-05 - 2003-12)

During my time working for Icarus, I mainly supported the London Borough of Waltham Forestâ€™s Lifelong Learning department.

At the Lifelong Learning Department of LBWF Council, I oversaw the IT department, resolving desktop and server related problems for 500 users both over the phone and through site visits, and by delegating tasks to other IT staff members. I administered the main Server room, looking after approximately 20 servers ranging from Citrix servers (A CD-ROM application server and a Leisure Centre application server) and other Windows based servers to the Solaris-based library catalogue system and a Netware GroupWise server.

I was occasionally seconded to Edmonton Green College, where I administered a network of approximately 120 PCs, supporting all hardware and software including NT user accounts, MS Office, printers and networking.

#### Projects

**_SOE Desktop._** I created a standard desktop environment for secure public access terminals, and helped to install desktops in all public libraries.

**_Firewall Install._** When a new fibre connection was ordered I custom-built an **OpenBSD** firewall to protect the network, and configured a secure ruleset and bandwidth throttling. A DMZ was created and all public-facing servers were moved into the DMZ.

**_Intranet Build._** To provide an Intranet site, I built an **Apache** web server on Windows 2000. I also installed a php-based forum for use by staff and integrated it into the Intranet site. Later I built a Mandrake **Linux** server running Apache 2, for hosting of an Internet site. I assisted with website design, using **CSS** and standards compliant **XHTML** in order to ensure that our web presence was in line with UK e-Government standards. I also installed a logfile analysis package to give staff access to metrics on website usage by the public.

**_Proxy Install._** I installed a Mandrake-based **Squid** proxy server, and configured it to allow different levels of filtering for staff and public. This also allowed measurement of bandwidth use of our fibre link.

**_Helpdesk System._** I installed a **FreeBSD** server with a web-based helpdesk application and used this to run the helpdesk, tracking all calls and delegating them to staff members' helpdesk accounts.

**_Library Catalog._** I installed and configured a Java-based application to provide an online access Library Catalogue, and edited the source code to integrate the visual style of the website with the existing corporate style.

**_Public Directory._** Similarly to the Library Catalogue project, I installed an XML-based public resources database with web front-end and edited the code to integrate it visually with the rest of LBWF's web applications.
