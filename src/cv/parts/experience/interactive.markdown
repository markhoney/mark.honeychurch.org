My primary role at Interactive was in hardware support, providing a first class service to our New Zealand customers. I covered **HP**, **IBM**, **Dell** and **Sun** servers, as well as **Cisco** networking equipment and **NetApp** and **PureStorage** storage hardware. I installed and supported hardware for many major customers across New Zealand.

During my time at Interactive I also created several software products for in-house consumption:

#### Projects

**_Business Analysis._** I created a dashboard for management allowing a view of the utilisation of all our field engineers. This was accomplished with direct SQL querying of our helpdesk system’s database, along with a web-based front end using **jQuery**, **Bootstrap** and the **D3** graphing library.

**_Rostering Website._** I developed a complex web-based scheduling system for Interactive's on-call rosters, using **Javascript**, **Moment**, **Vuetify**, the **Vue CLI** tool and **C#**.

**_Tracking System._** I created an end-to-end tracking software solution for our engineers, including an **iOS app** for interfacing with a ticketing system and reporting geolocation, a **Node.JS** and **Mongo** backend for data storage, and a **Vue** frontend with websockets for displaying realtime engineer locations and statuses, using **Docker** on **Linux** as a platform.

**_Rapid Development_** I was asked to develop a simple customer portal in 24 hours that would allow one of our customers to access details of their support contract with us. Using **Vue** and **Bootstrap**, and accessing existing data in multiple **Microsoft SQL** databases, I was able to code a secure, modern, responsive website that worked for all of our customers in less than a day.
