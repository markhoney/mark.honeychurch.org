### Support Analyst

![CVLogo](../logos/work/mungo.jpg) [St Mungo Association](https://www.mungos.org/) _London, England_ (2004-02 - 2004-10)

At St Mungo's, London's largest charity for homeless people, I worked in an Infrastructure Support role. This involved a lot of network troubleshooting, as the organisation consisted of over 50 remote sites all connecting to the Head Office using VPN through ADSL. Problems were fixed using NetSupport, a remote desktop solution, where possible. I also resolved many networking issues, both LAN and WAN and helped to configure the **Debian** based firewalls at each site.

I wrote several pieces of in-house documentation for general staff covering topics such as viruses, spyware, network shares and advanced Outlook use. I commissioned several new office sites, involving the installation and configuration of all networking equipment, PCs, servers and printers.

#### Projects

**_Automated Desktop Builds._** I conceived of and ran a major project to automate the Windows 2000 install, as most desktop hardware within the organisation was one of five models of PC. I created a fully automated install of Windows, using a choice of either CDs or a network share as the source media. The install scripts configured networking and other custom options for Windows and installed all applications required by staff, such as Acrobat reader, Microsoft Office and several bespoke applications.
