During my first contract with RSA I was responsible for the migration from WFW 3.11 to NT 4.0 at a range of sites in and around Sydney.
My second contract involved the administration of RSA's New South Wales NT network. This included creating and administering user accounts and Microsoft Exchange mailboxes for employees, looking after the ARCserve backups on a day-to-day basis and writing Kixtart logon scripts to set up user profiles, registry settings and desktops, and map network drives.
