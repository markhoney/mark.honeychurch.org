### Installations Engineer

![CVLogo](../logos/work/ubs.jpg) [UBS Warburg](https://www.ubs.com/) _London, England_ (2000-11 - 2001-05)

As a member of the trading floor desktop installations team, my primary role was the building, installation and support of Windows NT4 and Windows 2000 Workstations and Laptops. We supported several hundred traders and support staff, who would typically have several workstations each, including a primary NT4 workstation with quad-head display and dedicated **Bloomberg**, **NeXT** and **Sun** machines, along with 7 or 8 flat screen displays. I also installed and configured **Weytech** keyboards which allowed control of up to 6 workstations, as well as enabling workstation sharing, control of multiple screen switches, keyboard emulation (PC, Sun, Bloomberg, etc.) and key-press macro recording. The position also involved network troubleshooting, email support (**Outlook** and **CCMail**) and administration of NT user and resource domains.
