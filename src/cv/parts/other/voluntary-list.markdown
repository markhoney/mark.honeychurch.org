I have dedicated much of my spare time to working for charities, and have held the following positions:

- **Chair** of the **[NZ Skeptics](http://skeptics.nz)**
- **Secretary** of the **[Society for Science Based Healthcare](http://sbh.nz)**
- **President** of the **[Humanist Society](http://humanist.nz/)**
- **Council Member** of the **[NZARH](http://rationalists.nz/)**
- **Media Spokesperson** for the [Secular Education Network](http://religioninschools.co.nz/)
- **Treasurer** of **[Making Sense of Fluoride](http://msof.nz/)**
- **Co-founder** of **[CoderDojo New Zealand](http://coderdojo.nz/)**

These roles have involved people management, strategic planning, meeting statutory reporting requirements, overseeing projects, organising events, managing IT systems and protecting the public. As part of my voluntary work I have regularly talked with the media (newspapers, radio and TV), and from 2015 to 2018 I appeared on a regular radio segment on RadioLive called [Skeptical Thoughts with Mark Honeychurch](https://www.radiolive.co.nz/home/shows/weekend-variety-wireless-with-graeme-hill/skeptical-thoughts.html), where I talked about scientific skepticism and critical thinking.
