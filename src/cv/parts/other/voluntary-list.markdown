### Voluntary Work

I have dedicated much of my spare time to working for charities, and have held the following positions:

- **Chair** of the **[NZ Skeptics](http://skeptics.nz)**
- **Secretary** of the **[Society for Science Based Healthcare](http://sbh.nz)**
- **President** of the **[Humanist Society](http://humanist.nz/)**
- **Council Member** of the **[NZARH](http://rationalists.nz/)**
- **Media Spokesperson** for the [Secular Education Network](http://religioninschools.co.nz/)
- **Treasurer** of **[Making Sense of Fluoride](http://msof.nz/)**
- **Co-founder** of **[CoderDojo New Zealand](http://coderdojo.nz/)**

Many of these roles have involved protecting the public against untrue claims made by psychics, conspiracy theorists and purveyors of alternative medicine, and has involved regularly talking with the media (newspapers, radio and TV). From 2015 to 2018 I had a regular radio segment on RadioLive called [Skeptical Thoughts with Mark Honeychurch](https://www.radiolive.co.nz/home/shows/weekend-variety-wireless-with-graeme-hill/skeptical-thoughts.html), where I talked about scientific skepticism and critical thinking.
